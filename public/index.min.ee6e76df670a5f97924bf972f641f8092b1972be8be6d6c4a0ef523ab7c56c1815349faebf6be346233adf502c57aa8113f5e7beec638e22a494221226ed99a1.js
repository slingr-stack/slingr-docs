You can create one here. After creating an account, you can log in to the Developer Portal to manage your apps and start building something great. Within the Developer Portal, developers can manage their apps, organizations, endpoints, and account billing settings.
One developer account can have different roles in each app. There are three primary roles:
Developer: Developers have access to work on the app. Permissions are given per environment, so a developer could have access to the development environment but not the production one. Admin: Admins can change app settings like the plan, database settings, environments, and more. They can also grant permissions to new developers or remove an environment that is no longer used. Owner: An app can have many admins, but only one can be the owner. Usually, the owner is the user who created the app. However, ownership can be transferred. Owners have all the privileges of an admin and more. You can check the difference between an admin and an owner here. Environments and Components # As shown in the diagram, each app in Slingr has environments. Currently, Slingr supports up to three environments: development, staging, and production. Each environment consists of the following components:
Runtime: This component is responsible for taking the configurations done in the builder and generating the app. Monitor: The monitor allows you to see what&rsquo;s going on in the app during execution. See more information about the app monitor here. Builder: This component is where developers create the app by defining the data model, business logic, and integrations. See more information about the development of apps here. Environment Isolation # Environments in Slingr are fully isolated from each other to ensure stability and security:
Dedicated Memory and CPU: Each environment has its own instance for the runtime, monitor, and builder, with memory and CPU allocated for them. This allows you to work in your development environments without worrying about the production environment. Isolated Endpoints: Endpoints are independent execution processes with their memory and CPU allocation. If an endpoint experiences problems, your app will keep working. Additionally, each environment has its own endpoint instances, so issues in development won&rsquo;t propagate to production. Database: Each environment has its own database, which can be on shared or dedicated servers based on your needs. There is also a Slingr Free plan where instances are shared. Those are not meant for production. `}),e.add({id:2,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/overview/",title:"Overview",description:"",content:""}),e.add({id:3,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/overview/overview/",title:"Understanding the Slingr Platform",description:`Introduction # As described in What&rsquo;s Slingr?, Slingr is a platform designed for crafting cloud applications that seamlessly integrate with a range of SaaS solutions and internal apps.

Its core purpose is to enhance developer productivity by enabling them to concentrate on solving business challenges, rather than grappling with technical intricacies.
Slingr&rsquo;s methodology revolves around defining your application&rsquo;s data model and business rules. This definition, termed as the app&rsquo;s metadata, serves as the foundation that powers your app&rsquo;s execution. You can modify this metadata using the app builder.
Understanding app metadata # In the succeeding sections, we will delve into the essential components of app metadata that are crucial for creating applications in Slingr. To gain insight into metadata deployment and execution, refer to the documentation on Pushing and Syncing Changes, which also explains the process of making app alterations.
Model # A clear demarcation exists between the app&rsquo;s model and its user interface. The former encapsulates the app&rsquo;s data structure and behavior, while the latter dictates how this information is presented visually.
Slingr strives to follow a model-driven approach as much as possible. This means that the UI derives significant information from the model itself. Consequently, the UI is nearly auto-generated, with developers needing to specify only a few additional settings that can&rsquo;t be inferred from the model or that require customization.
The model essentially comprises entities, listeners, libraries, and legacy services, which are comprehensively described in the following sections.
Entities # Entities represent the cornerstone of app metadata. Think of them as an advanced version of database tables. In entities, you define the structure of the data you intend to persist within your app. However, entities offer features that elevate them far beyond traditional database tables:
Complex Data Models: Unlike conventional tables, entities support intricate data structures with multiple nesting levels and multi-valued fields. This approach reduces the necessity for a high number of entities, enhancing the cleanliness and comprehensibility of your app. Field Settings: Fields boast a multitude of settings beyond just their names and data types. These settings encompass requirements, read-only or editable statuses, calculated fields, default display preferences (thus eliminating repetitive UI definitions), permissions, validation rules, and more. While defining fields in entities, you concurrently configure numerous app settings that profoundly impact execution and rendering. Diverse Data Types: Each data type possesses its unique settings and display options. For instance, the text type allows you to set parameters like minimum or maximum length and choose between input methods such as text boxes or text areas. Slingr provides a broad spectrum of data types, each equipped with extensive settings, enabling you to furnish comprehensive information for each field in your entities. Actions: In addition to the standard actions of creating, reading, updating, and deleting records within an entity, you can define custom behaviors through actions. For instance, imagine an entity for tasks within a CRM app. This entity could include a custom action named &ldquo;Reject.&rdquo; When executed via the UI, this action prompts users to input a reason for rejection. The task is subsequently reopened, assigned to the relevant personnel, and the reason for rejection is stored as a note within the task. Such actions empower entities with custom behaviors, facilitating the creation of intricate execution workflows within your apps. Listeners: While listeners can serve a broader range of events, certain listeners are specifically designed for data events, aligning with entities. These listeners allow you to trigger actions when specific events occur within records, such as the creation of a new record, deletion of a record, or execution of an action. Permissions: You can define access privileges for entities, specifying which operations (create, edit, delete, actions, etc.) can be performed by different roles. Furthermore, granular permissions can be established at the field level. Entities encapsulate numerous aspects of your app. Consequently, when embarking on the creation of a new app, it&rsquo;s advisable to begin by defining the most pivotal entities.
For more in-depth information about entities, refer to this section.
Listeners # Listeners serve as hooks for various app events. For instance, you can trigger actions whenever a new record is created in a specific entity or respond to events originating from legacy services (e.g., creating a new record upon the creation of a contact in Google Contacts).
To explore listeners in greater detail, consult this section.
Libraries # Libraries comprise reusable JavaScript code snippets that can be employed across different sections of your app. For example, if you possess a Base64 encoding function that&rsquo;s utilized by multiple app actions, you can encapsulate this function in a library, making it easily accessible for actions that require it.
For comprehensive insights into libraries, visit this section.
Legacy services # Endpoints extend the capabilities of the platform, primarily facilitating seamless integration with various SaaS solutions like Slack, Google Calendar, SparkPost, and more. Nevertheless, legacy services aren&rsquo;t confined to integration purposes alone; they can also be harnessed for diverse use cases. For instance, let&rsquo;s assume you possess a Java library for file encryption that you intend to utilize within your app. In this scenario, you can create an legacy service integrating this Java library and subsequently leverage it within your app.
Feel free to incorporate multiple legacy services into your app, with each legacy service enhancing its functionalities. For information on existing legacy services or creating custom ones, refer to the relevant sections!
For comprehensive insights into legacy services usage, explore this section.
Permissions # Permissions empower you to define user capabilities within the app. Slingr offers highly granular permission control:
Entities: Permissions cover actions like creation, access, editing, deletion, and history tracking. Conditions can also be defined within entity permissions. For example, you can stipulate that a record can only be edited if the &ldquo;assignee&rdquo; field matches the current user. Fields: Permissions can be configured for each field, dictating whether it&rsquo;s read-only, read/write, or inaccessible. Actions: Permissions extend to actions, defining who can execute them and the parameters that can be passed to these actions. Views: Permissions encompass view accessibility. Permissions are organized within groups, and users can be assigned to one or multiple groups, resulting in permissions being dictated by the group configurations.
Although permissions are structured in groups, streamlining configuration, they can also be edited from the specific elements they govern (entities, fields, actions, and views).
Enforcement of permissions is evident both in the UI (e.g., users without permission to access an entity field won&rsquo;t see it) and in the REST API.
Workflows # With the amalgamation of entities, actions, listeners, legacy services, and permissions, robust and intricate workflows can be constructed to meet diverse requirements. Although the platform doesn&rsquo;t inherently possess a distinct &ldquo;workflow&rdquo; concept, combining these elements offers substantial flexibility for organizing your app.
User interface # Despite Slingr&rsquo;s capability to derive a wealth of information from the app model, the user interface (UI) is still customizable to cater to your preferences.
The UI of your app is structured as follows:
Header: Positioned at the top, it displays the app name and logo, which you can configure. Main Menu: This menu functions as the primary navigational tool, providing access to various sections of your app. Clicking menu items opens corresponding views in the main content area. Secondary Menu: Designed for view-associated items, this menu adds further items that are rendered in the main content area. User Menu: This menu encompasses system operations like &ldquo;My Profile&rdquo; or &ldquo;Logout,&rdquo; alongside items linked to app views, displayed within the main content area. Main Content: This region is dedicated to rendering the app&rsquo;s views. For customization of these UI components, refer to the User Interface section in the app builder. Typically, your journey starts with creating views for your entities and subsequently integrating them into the menus for seamless navigation.
Views and navigation # Views form the bedrock of your app&rsquo;s UI. A view essentially represents a visual rendering within the app&rsquo;s interface. While views can encompass diverse data representations and functionalities, most views are linked to app data, enabling diverse ways of presenting and interacting with this data.
For instance, you might establish a grid view associated with an entity representing companies. This view would list companies within your app, and its configuration would determine whether you can view details, edit records, or create new ones.
For a deeper exploration of views, refer to this section.
Navigation structures the path users take through your app. For instance, the configuration of the main menu, which dictates the content within the main content area, is determined by the navigation settings.
For more insights into navigation, refer to this section.
Field types display options # Most views present data originating from records defined in entities. Each field within these entities corresponds to a specific type, each of which possesses unique display options. For example, a choice field could be displayed as a dropdown menu or a switch.
While these type-specific rendering instructions are primarily configured at the entity level and serve as defaults, views can override these defaults to offer enhanced flexibility.

While you&rsquo;re free to follow your own approach, we suggest going through this guide initially to grasp the fundamental path. You can then adapt these guidelines to your specific needs.
The process # At Slingr, we embrace agile methodologies for software development. The platform is designed to facilitate agile implementation while building apps. This means you can swiftly set up a basic app, and gradually evolve and enhance it over time.
Following agile principles, we encourage developers to work in small iterations when creating apps. Start with a simple version that provides some value and can be used by people. Then, gradually add more features and make adjustments as needed.
The iterative cycle typically looks like this:
Model Your Entities: Begin by defining your app&rsquo;s entities, capturing the key aspects of your domain. Start by outlining the structure of fields and a few settings. You&rsquo;ll refine these settings over time as needed. Add Business Logic: Incorporate elements like actions, listeners, legacy services integrations, scripts for calculated values, and aggregations. These additions will transform your app from a mere record repository into a dynamic system. Create Views: Establish views for your entities. If you&rsquo;ve introduced new entities, create at least a grid view to support basic CRUD operations. If you already had views, adapt them to match changes in your model. Configure Permissions: Ensure that newly added or modified features are accessible by the appropriate user groups. Define Navigation: Integrate views into menus to enable user-friendly access to app features. Test Your App: Once you&rsquo;ve established the basics, push the changes and observe your app in action. Seeing your app function provides clarity on the next steps. Iterate to Your Ideal State: Go through this cycle iteratively until you reach a point where you&rsquo;re satisfied with the results. Slingr supports your journey with features like Automatic Refactorings, auto-generated UI, and the REST API. Remember, you don&rsquo;t need to follow all these steps in each iteration. Depending on the changes, some iterations might only affect action scripts, leaving views and permissions unchanged. This is meant as a flexible guideline.
Iterations can be very brief, lasting only a few hours or even minutes, especially in your development environment. However, for syncing to production, consider longer cycles that include well-tested changes.
Best practices # Start light # Avoid attempting to create everything in your initial iteration. Focus on the most critical use cases and establish the fundamentals. Share this version with your users and make improvements based on their feedback. This incremental approach reduces uncertainty and yields an app that aligns closely with user expectations.
Optimize your development environment # Ensure that your development environment provides access to all features, and that they function optimally. For instance, if your app integrates with Slack, create a dedicated Slack team for your development environment to test Slack integrations. Avoid testing in the production environment whenever possible.
Enable comprehensive testing in your development environment. Create accounts for integrated services dedicated to your development environment, allowing developers to access and interact with these services. Having sufficient data in your development environment for various use cases will significantly accelerate development.
Prioritize versioning # When pushing changes, consider creating a backup of your app&rsquo;s metadata. This safeguard enables you to revert to a previous version if unintended issues arise.
Although you might not want to create version backups after every change, doing so when completing a significant task is wise. Include detailed notes describing the changes made in each version to facilitate future reference.
Handle production sync with care # During synchronization to the production environment, remember that your app will be briefly stopped, changes applied, and then the app restarted. This means your app won&rsquo;t be accessible to users during this time.
In many cases, downtime could be just a few seconds and won&rsquo;t impact users. However, extensive changes affecting numerous records, such as field renaming or removal, might extend the downtime. Keep this in mind when planning your synchronization to the production environment.
`}),e.add({id:6,href:"/slingrDoc/extending/getting_started/overview/",title:"Overview",description:`What are legacy services? # Endpoints are crucial components that extend the functionality of the Slingr platform.
👉 An legacy service is essentially a piece of software that operates alongside your app, providing additional features and capabilities. For instance, you can implement an legacy service that offers cryptographic algorithms, enabling your app to utilize them securely.
Seamless app integration # One of the primary use cases for legacy services is seamless integration with other applications, especially cloud-based services.`,content:`What are legacy services? # Endpoints are crucial components that extend the functionality of the Slingr platform.
👉 An legacy service is essentially a piece of software that operates alongside your app, providing additional features and capabilities. For instance, you can implement an legacy service that offers cryptographic algorithms, enabling your app to utilize them securely.
Seamless app integration # One of the primary use cases for legacy services is seamless integration with other applications, especially cloud-based services. Slingr offers an official legacy services registry, which houses various legacy services designed to facilitate smooth integration with popular services such as Slack, Google Calendar, or SparkPost.
As shown in the diagram above, apps can use the API provided by the legacy service to send messages to another app. For example, it could be a method to retrieve available calendars from an external calendar service:
var calendars = app.endpoints.calendarEndpoint.findCalendars(); sys.logs.info('Calendars: '+ JSON.stringify(calendars)); When an legacy service is added to an app, its API will be accessible through functions defined in the scripts under the namespace app.endpoints.&lt;endpointName&gt;, as shown in the example above. To understand the API details, refer to the documentation for each specific legacy service.
Another aspect of the legacy service&rsquo;s API is the handling of events, which are messages sent from the endpoint to the app. These events can be captured by legacy service listeners , allowing you to take specific actions upon their arrival. For instance, you can create a listener to capture an event when a new contact is created on Google Contacts and perform actions accordingly.
sys.logs.info('New contact: '+ JSON.stringify(event.data)); app.contacts.createContactInApp(event.data); So, legacy services extend the platform in two ways: A new API under the namespace app.endpoints.&lt;endpointName&gt; that can be accessed through scripts. Events that can be caught using legacy service listeners. Some legacy services will also provide a webhook URL where you can receive an asynchronous response from your endpoint. These can be handled using legacy service listeners so the app can act upon a received response. You can find more information on how to use legacy services here.
Legacy service configuration # Legacy services can be added to an app in the app builder, in the Model &gt; Legacy services section. Here, you can set the configuration of legacy services, which basically consists of the type of legacy service, name, and some legacy-service-specific settings like API keys, users, passwords, etc.
By default, the latest version of the legacy service will be selected, and if the legacy service is updated, it will always deploy the latest version. If you select a specific version of the legacy service, you can choose the upgrade policy to automatically upgrade to compatible versions or to fix the version you previously selected.
You can find more information about the configuration of legacy services here.
Legacy service lifecycle # When you add a new legacy service in the app builder, you are just defining its configuration. To deploy the legacy service, you need to push changes (it will be deployed only if the initial status is Deployed). When that happens, the legacy service will be deployed, and from there, the status of the legacy service should be handled from the app monitor.
In the app monitor, in the legacy services section, you will be able to restart, undeploy, and deploy legacy services. The lifecycle of legacy services is independent of the app. This means that when you restart an endpoint, your app keeps working, and vice versa. If events happened in the middle, operations will be retried so no events are lost.
If you no longer need an legacy service, you can remove it from the app builder, and the legacy service will be deleted when changes are pushed. Remember to manually delete usages of an legacy service in scripts if you are going to delete it.
Create your own legacy services # Finally, it is possible to create your own legacy services to extend what the platform can do and connect to other services that aren&rsquo;t included in the official legacy services. Learn more about that here.

The approach followed by Slingr is to have you describe your data model and business rules, which will then be used to create your application. The idea behind this approach is to allow you to focus on solving business problems rather than dealing with technical issues that often arise when using more low-level tools like Java or .Net.
Our goal is to significantly increase productivity when creating apps.
On the other hand, we acknowledge that many SaaS solutions are purpose-built and highly efficient for specific problems. Attempting to replicate them within Slingr would be counterproductive. Therefore, our approach is to provide tools that enable easy integration of existing cloud apps, freeing you to concentrate on creating custom workflows tailored to your business needs.
This means you define the business rules and data model, and in return, you automatically get a working app with a user interface and a REST API that allows your app to be used by other applications. Slingr offers a wide range of features to help you model your business requirements effectively. It is designed to create real-world apps, not just trivial prototypes.
As every developer knows, businesses evolve, and apps must evolve with them. Slingr provides mechanisms that enable you to quickly and cost-effectively evolve your apps with minimal risk. When you make changes to your app, it is automatically refactored to reflect those modifications, simplifying the evolution process.
Additionally, Slingr provides tools to monitor your apps, ensure data security, and maintain control at all times.
Finally, everything happens on the cloud, eliminating the need for you to set up or maintain any servers, configure development environments, or worry about user terminals.
Slingr offers an end-to-end cloud solution.
Highlights # - Focus on solving business problems instead of technical issues. - Increase your productivity to create cloud apps. - Integrate with existing cloud apps. - Define your data model and business rules while the UI is generated. - Auto-generated REST API to easily integrate your app. - Easily evolve your apps as your business does. - End-to-end cloud solution, from development to your end users. How It Works # As explained before, you need to define your data model and business rules in the builder. The app runtime will then use this definition to execute the specified actions and conditions.
To provide a simplified example of how it works, let&rsquo;s consider an entity called &ldquo;Companies&rdquo; with a few properties. This entity defines your data model. Additionally, you might have actions and conditions to activate/deactivate a company, along with some rules that trigger when a company changes its status, resulting in the owner being notified by email.
Below, you can observe the data model definition and the resulting app displayed in a web browser:
Apart from the UI, the following REST API will be generated:
POST /data/companies GET /data/companies/{id} GET /data/companies PUT /data/companies/{id} DELETE /data/companies/{id} PUT /data/companies/{id}/activate PUT /data/companies/{id}/deactivate The idea is that you only need to take care of the problems you need to solve, instead of worrying about which database to use, which technologies for the backend and frontend, or spending time setting up servers and development environments, etc. You just need to focus on your business requirements, and we&rsquo;ll take care of the rest :)
This is a highly simplified example to demonstrate the basics of how Slingr works, but you can achieve much more powerful functionalities with it. In the next section, we will describe a few use cases.
Use Cases # Create an app to support your business # In this scenario, you need an application to support your main business processes, and you want to integrate it with specific systems such as email and payment gateways. With Slingr, you can easily create this application by defining your business rules, permissions for different users, and more. Next, you should configure endpoints for the integrations you require and set up the integration points.
Glue your existing apps # In this case, you are already using various cloud apps. You can leverage Slingr to coordinate workflows in your business, breaking silos between different departments. Here are some use cases for the schema described above:
Custom support will utilize Zendesk. Some information will flow into Slingr, such as log types of issues, resolutions, surveys from customers, or escalated issues to different departments. For example, if there&rsquo;s an issue that requires developer attention, the customer support representative will escalate the issue to development, creating an issue on the Slingr app, which in turn, will trigger the creation of a ticket in JIRA. Managers and executives will have the ability to monitor ongoing activities using SLNGR. There&rsquo;s no need to log into each specific app to obtain information about the state of the business. After running billing processes, charges are moved to QuickBooks, where accountants can handle them. When a developer closes a ticket on JIRA that was previously escalated by support, an email is sent to customer support, notifying them that the problem has been resolved. There is a mobile app that utilizes the REST API to extract and insert information into the app on Slingr. This mobile app has a highly customized UI and only exposes a limited set of functionalities that are relevant to the user. Customize a template app # In this case, instead of creating an app from scratch on Slingr, you can take one of the template apps and adapt them to your business needs.
This can apply also to your own apps. Let&rsquo;s suppose you build an app for lawyers, and you want to sell it to different companies, but each company has its own requirements. In this case, you can have a template app, and then for each company, you can customize what they need without affecting other apps.
Use it as a backend for mobile apps # Due to the exceptional REST API automatically generated for your app, it becomes incredibly easy to develop mobile apps tailored to specific purposes. These mobile apps can effortlessly pull and push data to the Slingr app, effectively acting as a backend. As long as the mobile app can access the Slingr API, it can be either native or use HTML5.
In the diagram example above, employees utilize the app on Slingr, whereas customers interact with mobile apps featuring enhanced user interfaces adapted for specific purposes.

Name: This is the internal name of your app. It&rsquo;s required and cannot contain spaces or special characters, and it must be unique. It will be used as the subdomain of your app: &lt;app-name&gt;.slingrs.io.
&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; You won&rsquo;t be able to change the name of your app later. App owner: You can choose to be the owner of the app or select an organization that you belong to.
Plan: This is the plan your app will run on. You can choose between three different plans depending on your needs:
Slingr Free: This plan is free and is useful to understand the platform and learn how to use it, however, it is not suited for complex or production apps. Slingr Dev: This is an isolated environment with a fixed price that allows developers to have personal apps for a reasonable price. It has some limitations. Slingr Pro: This is a usage-based plan meant for applications in production environments that need dedicated resources and outstanding performance. There are no limitations with the Slingr Pro plan. You can see the full comparison in Pricing and Billing.
Template: You can choose to start from scratch, with an empty app, or you can choose one of the available templates. Here you will find global templates created by other people, or you can also create your own templates. See App templates for more information.
When you select a template, you might decide to make it linked by setting the flag Linked, which is only available if you select Slingr Pro as the plan. If this flag is set, the new app will be linked to the template. This means that the new app will only have a production environment, and when changes are synced in the template app, those changes will be applied to this new app as well. If you don&rsquo;t set this flag, only a development environment will be created using the app template, but it will be completely independent from the original app, which means new changes in the template won&rsquo;t affect the new app, and vice versa.
By default, when you create a new app, only the development environment (unless you have set the Linked flag) is created with the selected plan.
✅ You can add a production environment later or change the plan if needed. Additionally, your developer account will be set as the admin, owner, and developer for the new app.
App settings # Once an app is created, you will see the following options:
Label: This is a user-friendly name of your app that was provided during the creation process. You can change the app&rsquo;s label at any time.
Description: This is an internal description of your app. This field is for internal use or, if the app is a template, it will be used as the template&rsquo;s description.
App logos: These are the logos, favicon, and background of the app. They will be displayed in different places, such as the Developer portal, your app&rsquo;s header, the browser&rsquo;s title, etc. We recommend using a transparent background, but you are free to choose any.
Any changes you make to these settings will be applied immediately.
App Environment Settings # Apps can have three different environments:
Development: This is the main environment that developers will use to make their changes. It&rsquo;s the default environment.
Staging: This environment can be used as a buffer between development and production. Additionally, when you are in production and you need to fix something, this environment is ideal to apply hotfixes in Production without syncing all the changes in Development.
Production: This is the production environment your users will access. This environment does not have the builder component because you should never change your app directly in production.
👉 By default, a new app will only have the Development environment, but you can easily add new ones as you need them.
👉 Each app environment has the following settings:
Status: Indicates in which status the environment is. If the value is different than Deployed, it could be that some maintenance work is going on (for example, the platform is being upgraded) or there is a problem, and you should contact support.
Version: This is the current version your app is running on. We periodically release new updates to the platform, and we automatically update apps when that&rsquo;s possible. If your app is behind, you will be able to manually trigger an update when you find it more convenient.
Instances: This is the number of runtime instances for this environment. The more instances you have, the more requests and work your environment can handle, so this is a good way to scale your app. Keep in mind that more instances also mean more usage, so be sure you understand how Pricing and Billing work in your plan. It could be that not all instances are available at all times, for example, when you just added them, or there is some maintenance work. In that case, it will be shown how many instances are deployed and running out of the desired number of instances. Apart from the number of instances, you can also configure the size of each instance. You will need bigger instances as your app gets more complex. Don&rsquo;t worry; we will notify you if your instances are running out of resources. Here you should consider upgrading the size of your instance. The available sizes are:
Small (1GB): This is the default size for apps. It is meant for small apps. Medium (2GB): This is for medium apps. Large (4GB): This is for big apps when there are many entities, views, listeners, endpoints, etc. Database: Just adding more instances might not work to scale your app as there is a point where the database will be the bottleneck. When you reach that point (usually we try to size the database based on data size so you know when to switch), you should update the database of the app environment from here. Please take a look at Pricing and Billing to understand how this will impact your invoice.
Custom domain: By default, your app will be available at &lt;appname&gt;.slingrs.io; however, you can use your domain as well, for example, myapp.com. To do that, you need to own the domain and have a valid SSL certificate. Just click on Set your domain, and you will be asked to enter the domain and SSL certificate information.
There are a few cases that need changes in settings that deserve more attention:
Scaling Up and Down Your App # The way to scale your app is by adding more instances. How many instances you need depends on your app and the load it has, so it is hard to say how many users or API requests an instance can handle.
What we recommend is to watch out for the response time of your app and add more instances when you see it goes above your maximum desired value or when you see that the waiting time of background jobs is growing. You can check those things in the app monitor.
Also, keep in mind that adding more instances might not help if the database is the bottleneck. In this case, you should upgrade your database to take advantage of the additional instances. You can check the slow queries report in the app monitor to see if the database is the bottleneck.
The same way you can add instances, you can remove them. When you do that, some instances will be gracefully stopped and undeployed until the desired number of instances is met.
Changing the Database # 🚨 Depending on the source and the target database type, changing the database could cause a downtime of your app. If you are upgrading from a shared database to another shared database, in most cases, it won&rsquo;t mean any downtime, and the data size limit will be updated immediately. If it happens that we need to do some migrations, we will notify you, and you should confirm before proceeding.
If you are upgrading from a database in shared servers to one in dedicated servers, a migration will be needed, and your app will be down during that time.
If you are upgrading from a database in dedicated servers to another database in dedicated servers, migration can be done without any downtime.
Keep in mind that you will only be able to downgrade your database if the data size fits in the new database type.
Manage Developers and Admins # When you create an app, you automatically become the admin owner and a developer for it. However, you can add permissions to other developers to work in your app or give them admin permissions.
Developers # In the Developers section of the app details, you can add more developers by entering the email associated with their developer accounts. Once you add a developer, you can choose which environments they will have access to.
When you give access to one environment, the developer will be able to use all components in it, such as runtime, builder, and monitor. Additionally, a user will be created in the environment for that developer. So, if you go to the screen to manage users in that environment, you will see the developer listed as a user. These users will belong to the Developers group and cannot be modified (you can only assign new groups, but cannot change the password, name, etc.). They will be automatically managed and synced. For example, if the developer changes their password, it will be updated in all apps.
One important thing about developer users is that permissions defined in the app won’t affect developers as they always have permissions for everything. The exception is when you assign groups to the developer in that app. If you do so, the developer user will use those groups’ permissions by default.
If you need to test permissions while developing your app, you should create other regular users, assign groups to your developer user in that app, or use the &quot;Switch groups&quot; option available in the user menu of the app runtime.
Admins # ℹ️ Admins are not allowed to use the app. If you want to, the admin should also be a developer. 👉 In the Admins section of the app details, you can indicate which developer accounts will have admin permissions over the app.
👉 Admins can perform the following actions:
Add/remove developers Change general settings of the app Change settings of the app environment 👉 Furthermore, there is only one admin who is also the owner of the app (by default the creator of the app). The owner can perform the following actions:
Add/remove admins Transfer ownership to another admin Put the app to sleep or wake it up Delete the app 👉 Ownership can be transferred by adding a new admin and then, after selecting that admin, clicking on the button Transfer ownership to this admin.
Sleeping and Wake Up # If your app is not going to be used for a period, you can put it to Sleep. This way you can avoid charges while still keeping your app. Later, if you need it again, you can wake it up and continue using it as usual.
This can be done by clicking the buttons Sleep app and Wake up app.
ℹ️ This action can only be performed by the app owner. Adding New Environments # When an app is created, by default, it only has a Development environment. We recommend keeping only the development environment until you see the need for another environment.
Production Environment # If you need a Production environment, you can easily add it by clicking the Add production environment button.
When you add a production environment, it will be created based on your current development environment. However, keep in mind that data won&rsquo;t be copied. You should export and import records from Development to Production if you need to do so.
Also, if you want developers to access the production environment, you will need to explicitly set permissions, even if they already had permissions for the development environment.
Staging Environment # Once you have a development and a production environment, you might see the need for an additional environment to work as a buffer between development and production. This is the Staging environment, and you can add it by clicking the Add staging environment button.
This environment is very useful for doing QA and also for performing hotfixes of issues that show up in production.
Unlink app # If you created the app from a template with the Linked flag, the app will only have a production environment, and you won&rsquo;t be able to make changes. Instead, changes are made in the template app and synced to the clones.
If, at some point, you need to make changes to the app, you will need to unlink the app first. You can do that by clicking on the Unlink button in the app&rsquo;s details. When the app is unlinked, a Development environment is added to the app.
&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; You won&rsquo;t be able to link it again to the template, and the apps will become independent from each other. Development environment in linked apps # There are cases where you need to make some changes to a linked app, but you don&rsquo;t want to unlink it because you still want to get updates from the master app.
In these cases, you can add a development environment by clicking on Add development environment. When you do this, how changes are synced will be altered. Please check the section Pushing and Syncing changes for more details.
Delete App # If you no longer need an app, you can delete it. This will remove all instances as well as the database, which means all data will be lost.
🚨 This operation cannot be undone, so please be careful. ℹ️ Only the app owner can perform this action. App Templates # If you want to turn an app into a template, you can do so by enabling the Make this app a template flag. Once this option is enabled, your app will appear in the list of templates when creating new apps (inside your account only).
Cloning Apps # You can create a clone of your app by clicking the Clone App button. This will create a new app using the same plan as the current app with the selected environment. Please note that data will also be copied (up to 1,000 records per entity).
✅ Cloning your apps is useful when you want to test some changes in your app without affecting the original version. `}),e.add({id:12,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/metadata-management/",title:"Metadata management",description:"",content:""}),e.add({id:13,href:"/slingrDoc/getting-started/getting/first-steps/main/",title:"Tutorials",description:`The best way to learn how to use Slingr is to build something.

Top Section: A table at the top that lists all the various changes made to the resource, organized by timestamp. Additional information such as the user, change type, and path of the metadata are also displayed. Clicking on any of these entries will unveil another table in the bottom section. Bottom Section (1st Tab): In this section, you can peruse a comprehensive list of every property altered during the selected timestamp. Bottom Section (2nd Tab): Switching to this tab, you can inspect an in-depth list of properties that have undergone automatic changes during the timestamp. These alterations are the outcome of platform-applied refactoring rules. For instance, creating a new field in an entity with existing record views will result in an automatic creation of the new field in those record views. `}),e.add({id:27,href:"/slingrDoc/extending/official-ui-plugins/metamask/",title:"Metamask",description:`This plugin allows users to sign transactions using the MetaMask browser extension.

If the user confirms the transaction, the approved callback gets executed. Otherwise, if the user declines the transaction or there is an error, the declined callback is executed.
If there are other errors, the error callback will be called. For example, if the account is not configured in MetaMask, an 'invalidAccount' error will be returned, or 'invalidNetwork' if the network MetaMask is connected to is different from the network requested.

The tx data should be in the &lsquo;data&rsquo; field (see eth.sendTransaction for more information), while you can pass two callbacks:
approved: the user approved the transaction, and it was submitted to the network. You should check the status of the transaction to see if it was confirmed. Parameter 'msg' contains the original message sent to the plugin (where you can add more fields if you need them in the callback) while 'res' contains the tx object and txHash. declined: the user didn&rsquo;t approve the transaction, or there was a problem, and the tx could not be submitted to the network. 'msg' contains the original message sent to the plugin, and you could find the error in 'res.error'. Additionally, there is an 'error' callback for handling account or network-related errors. These are the possible error codes:
'invalidAccount': if the account to sign the transaction is not configured in MetaMask. 'invalidNetwork': if the network MetaMask is connected to is different from the network requested. Sign data # sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'plugin:metamask', name: 'signData', data: '0x000......', // this is the tx data callbacks: { approved: function(msg, res) { sys.logs.debug(&quot;signed: &quot;+res.signedData); sys.logs.debug(&quot;original msg: &quot;+JSON.stringify(msg)); }, declined: function(msg, res) { sys.logs.debug(&quot;error: &quot;+res.error); sys.logs.debug(&quot;original msg: &quot;+JSON.stringify(msg)); } } }); Signs data using the MetaMask plugin.

Moreover, these expressions can be easily translated into database queries, making them particularly useful when you need to retrieve all records that match a specific expression.`,content:`Expressions in Slingr # Expressions in Slingr consist of sets of conditions that can be grouped using AND and OR operators. These expressions can be evaluated against a record, resulting in a true value if the record matches the expression, and false if it doesn&rsquo;t.
Moreover, these expressions can be easily translated into database queries, making them particularly useful when you need to retrieve all records that match a specific expression.
While in many cases, expressions can be replaced by scripts (with that option being available when applicable), it is recommended to define your conditions using expressions for several reasons:
Maintainability: Expressions are automatically refactored whenever fields are modified, eliminating the need for manual adjustments in most instances. Usability: Expressions can be created using the UI, offering a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Database queries: For many scenarios, expressions can be directly applied to the database. In cases where queries are necessary, you won&rsquo;t be able to use scripts (such as for access permissions). Expressions are associated with a target entity, which contains the records against which the expression is evaluated. They comprise a set of conditions that can be organized using AND and OR groups.
Each filter within an expression has the following attributes:
Target field: This refers to a field in the target entity that will be filtered, except in cases of By user value. Operator: Used to filter the field (available operators depend on the field type). Value: The filtering value, which can be hard-coded (By value or By user value), obtained from a field in a record (By record field), or taken from a field in the user extended fields record (By user field). Complex expressions can be built by combining groups and conditions. For instance, an example expression could look like this:
- AND - By value: type = 'a' - OR - By value: state = 'inactive' - By value: name like 'test' Expressions are a versatile concept used in various contexts within the app definition. Paying close attention to the context is essential to understand the target entity and the potential source entity (in conditions of type By record field).
For instance, consider the following scenarios:
In a By value condition for read/write access in an entity field, the target entity will be the entity housing the field. If the condition is of type By record field in the filter of a relationship field, the target entity will be the entity that the relationship points to, while the source entity will be the entity with the relationship field. Groups # AND # All elements within an AND group must evaluate to true for the group itself to evaluate to true. If one or more elements within the group evaluate to false, the entire group will be considered false. It&rsquo;s possible to have nested OR groups inside an AND group.
OR # For an OR group to evaluate to true, at least one element within the group must evaluate to true. If all elements within the group evaluate to false, the group will be evaluated as false. Similar to AND groups, it&rsquo;s possible to have nested AND groups inside an OR group.
Conditions # Conditions within expressions have the following structure:
Target Field - Operator - Value For example:
type - Equals - 'a' The different types of conditions are distinguished by how the \`Value\` is set. It can be: - Hard-coded (\`By value\` or \`By user value\`) - Obtained from a field in a record (\`By record field\`) - Obtained from a field in the user extended fields record (\`By user field\`) Understanding how these conditions work with multi-valued fields or many values is crucial.
When the target field is single-valued and there are multiple values, if any of the values match the value of the target field, the condition evaluates to true. When the target field is multi-valued and there&rsquo;s only one value, if that value matches any of the values of the target field, the condition evaluates to true. When the target field is multi-valued and there are multiple values, if any value matches any of the values in the target field, the condition evaluates to true. By value # In this condition type, the value is hard-coded. Depending on the selected operator, you can specify one or more values.
By record field # Here, the value is obtained from a field in a record (the Source field).
For instance, in configuring filters for a relationship field, you might filter records of the target entity based on the type field, which should equal the value of the companyType field in the source record. This dynamic filtering ensures that the results differ from record to record.
By user field # User conditions rely on the User extended fields feature, which must be enabled in the app before using this condition type.
In this case, the value is obtained from the field in the user extended record (the Source field) of the current user. Thus, these conditions work when there&rsquo;s a current user with an associated user extended fields record; otherwise, the condition evaluates to false.
For example, the companies field in the user extended fields entity could indicate the companies users work for. With a tasks entity featuring a company field, you could ensure that users only see tasks for companies they work for by applying a By user field condition in the permissions.
By user value # This filter combines the characteristics of By user field and By value. The value is hard-coded as By value, but the Target field belongs to an entity configured in the User extended fields.
Operators # The operation determines how the field is filtered. Available operations depend on the field type defined in field. Possible operations include:
equals: Equivalent to an any condition, tests if any element of the current value is in the filter value. notEquals: Equivalent to a not in condition, tests if the current value is not in the filter value. like: Similar to equals, but matches partial values. between: Specifies a range where the current value should lie. greater: Equivalent to the math operator for number types. greaterOrEquals: Equivalent to the math operator for number types. less: Equivalent to the math operator for number types. lessOrEquals: Equivalent to the math operator for number types. empty: The current value must be null or an empty list. notEmpty: The current value must not be null and not an empty list. Query format # Expressions can also be represented in query language, which is useful when passing expressions in scripts. For instance:
// this is a simple query expression where field 'company' should be equals to 'GOOGLE' { company: 'GOOGLE' } // this query expression is to filter by companies with 'type' in 'a' or 'b', // or with 'numberOfPeople' greater or equals to 100 { _or: { type: ['a', 'b'], numberOfPeople: 'greaterOrEquals(100)' } } // this query expression is to filter companies by the related company to the logged user { name: 'currentUserField(company.name)' } The way to map filters is by utilizing the field name and the value to filter for. Within the value section, an operation can be specified. The available operations are contingent on the field type defined in field. These include:
equals notEquals like between greater greaterOrEquals less lessOrEquals empty notEmpty currentUserField For a deeper understanding of the query language and the valid operators, please refer to the documentation on Complex Query Language.

The production environment does not allow direct changes; instead, you need to synchronize changes (see below). However, you can adjust environment settings from the app monitor to customize behavior (more on environment settings below).
Next, we will outline the process for implementing changes to your apps and synchronizing those changes to the production environment.
Making changes to your app # You can modify your app&rsquo;s metadata through the app builder. Here, you can view your app&rsquo;s definition and implement necessary changes. Note that these changes won&rsquo;t take effect immediately; they need to be pushed to the app runtime, where they will be applied. For instance, if you add a new field using the app builder, you won&rsquo;t see it in the app immediately after saving. First, you need to push the changes, and once this is done, the new field will appear in the app runtime of the development environment.
You can push changes from the app builder using the Push changes action in the secondary menu (a shortcut is also available with Ctrl + P). When changes are pushed, you&rsquo;ll see a summary of the changes that will be pushed, and you&rsquo;ll have the option to create a backup and provide an explanation for the changes.
Enabling the backup flag creates a version that can be restored later. Typically, you wouldn&rsquo;t create a backup with every push; rather, you&rsquo;d do so when you need a restore point.
Importantly, understand the impact of pushing changes:
The app will be halted in the development environment (production remains unaffected). Metadata changes are transferred to the app runtime. If metadata changes affect data, necessary data adjustments are made. For instance, if a field is deleted, all records of that entity will be updated to remove the field. Changes to legacy services are deployed, removed, or redeployed. The app is restarted. Synchronizing changes to production # Once you&rsquo;ve tested all changes in the development environment, if you have a production environment in your app, you can sync these changes from development to production.
From the app builder, use the Sync changes to prod action in the secondary menu to synchronize changes. During this process, you&rsquo;ll see a summary of the changes that will be moved to production. It&rsquo;s important to note that only changes that have been pushed will be synced. Any changes made in the app builder but not yet pushed won&rsquo;t be synchronized.
When syncing changes, the following steps occur:
App metadata is exported from the development environment. The production environment is halted. App metadata is imported into the production environment. Data refactorings are carried out. Legacy services are synchronized. The production app is restarted. Depending on the nature of changes and any required data refactorings, this process might take some time. Ensure you understand the implications of potential data refactorings (see Automatic Refactorings) and sync changes at a time that minimally impacts operations.
Additionally, keep in mind that if your app is linked to others, changes will also be synced across linked apps, following the same process described above.
Automated Issue Resolution # Before initiating the sync process, the application metadata undergoes validation. If validation uncovers errors, a tool to automatically resolve these issues will be available.
Incorporating a staging environment # A staging environment can be added as an intermediary between development and production. Some use cases include:
Hotfixes: Your staging environment can mirror your production version. In the event of a production issue, you can fix it in staging and then sync the fix to production, avoiding unintended changes from development. QA: After completing a development iteration, instead of syncing directly to production, you can sync to staging, perform regression testing, and then sync to production once testing is complete. When a staging environment is present, changes made in development are synced to staging first, and then you can proceed to sync them to production.
Pulling Changes # The pull process involves two stages:
Fetch Changes: Obtain changes from the source environment you want to merge with. Merge Changes: Apply changes from the source environment into your development environment. The source could be staging or a parent app. If changes are made in the staging environment, you won&rsquo;t be able to directly sync changes from development to staging. Instead, you need to first pull changes from staging. This requires accessing the app builder in your development environment and executing the Pull changes action from the secondary menu.
This operation merges changes from staging into the development environment, allowing you to subsequently sync them to staging.
Pulling changes in linked apps # For apps created from a template with the Linked flag set, updates from the master app are received automatically. However, if you&rsquo;ve added a development environment to your linked app, changes in the master app won&rsquo;t be applied automatically to production. Instead, you&rsquo;ll need to go to your development environment and pull the changes made in the template.
This step is necessary to handle potential conflicts between changes in the master app and your linked app. After pulling changes, you can then incorporate them into your app.
Environment settings # You may have noticed that there is no app builder available in the production environment. This is because making direct changes in the production environment is discouraged. Changes should be made in the development or staging environment, tested, and then synced to production.
However, your production environment might require slightly different behavior than your development or staging environments. This could involve using a different API key, an alternative alerts policy, or even a distinct theme for easy differentiation between production and development.
This is where environment settings come into play. These settings can be customized per environment and, combined with metadata, influence how your app operates.
You can modify environment settings from the app builder in the development or staging environment. For the production environment, these settings can be adjusted using the app monitor.
For more information on different environment settings, refer to the following documentation:

Automatic refactorings are an instrumental feature in this regard, greatly facilitating the evolution of your app.
When you introduce changes to your app, we strive to propagate these changes systematically, minimizing the need for manual adjustments across multiple areas. The following are examples of automatic refactorings:
Field Addition: If you add a new field to an entity, the field will be automatically integrated into all managed views. Field Deletion: When a field is deleted, it will be seamlessly removed from all views and actions. Field Renaming: Should you rename a field, the change will be applied universally, including the database. Field Sorting: Sorting fields within an entity will trigger the same sorting in managed views. The primary objective of these automatic refactorings is to expedite development by reducing the need for manual adjustments.
It&rsquo;s essential to note that not all aspects can be refactored automatically. For instance, scripts are not currently included in these automatic refactorings, although this is on our roadmap for future development.
Refactorings can be classified into two categories: metadata refactorings and data refactorings, which are elucidated further in the subsequent sections.
Metadata refactorings # Metadata refactorings encompass changes that exclusively influence the metadata of the app. For instance, if fields are reordered within an entity, managed views will be automatically adjusted to match the new field order.
These refactorings take effect immediately after changes are made in the app builder (although they won&rsquo;t be visible until changes are pushed). Following the aforementioned example, once the fields are reordered, the views will be automatically reconfigured. Consequently, upon opening the views in the app builder, the new field arrangement will be evident.
Data refactorings # Conversely, data refactorings result in modifications to the app&rsquo;s data. For example, if an entity is deleted, all records associated with that entity will be purged from the database.
Since changes are only accessible at runtime, data refactorings occur during the process of pushing or synchronizing changes.
It&rsquo;s crucial to be aware that certain changes can trigger both metadata and data refactorings simultaneously. Deleting a field, for instance, will prompt the refactoring of metadata references to that field, as well as the adjustment of records to remove the deleted field.
Here is a list of changes that trigger data refactorings:
Adding a required field with a default value Introducing a calculated field Renaming a field (changing the name, not the label) Deleting a field Modifying copied fields within a relationship field Adjustments to type rules that impact stored data Altering field calculation logic Deleting an entity Renaming an entity Setting a field as unique or indexable (leading to index creation) Removing the unique or indexable flag from a field (resulting in index removal) Adding, modifying, or removing an index If these changes are applied to entities with substantial record counts, be aware that the process may take some time and your app will be temporarily unavailable during this period.

The process of creating a new endpoint involves three fundamental steps:
Endpoint Creation: Design and set up your new endpoint. Testing via Proxy Endpoint: Thoroughly test your endpoint using the proxy endpoint. Endpoint Registration: Register your developed endpoint within the Slingr developer portal. Endpoint creation # To get started, you need to create a new endpoint. We recommend following one of these guides based on your preferred programming language:
Java SDK Node SDK Testing via proxy endpoint # Overview # For developing and testing your custom endpoints, there&rsquo;s a dedicated endpoint designed to assist you—the Proxy Endpoint:
When you initiate the creation of a new endpoint in the app builder, you will find the option for the Proxy Endpoint in the list of available endpoints. This particular endpoint is designed to proxy the one running on your local machine, as depicted in the diagram above.
Please be aware that communication between the proxy endpoint and your local endpoint might occur over HTTP instead of HTTPS. In such cases, refrain from transmitting sensitive information to ensure security. Proxy purposes # The proxy endpoint serves the following purposes:
When your app invokes a function on the endpoint&rsquo;s API, the proxy endpoint initiates a call to your local endpoint. This local endpoint then processes the request and forwards the response back to the proxy endpoint. Whenever an event occurs in your local endpoint, it is transmitted to the proxy endpoint, which subsequently relays it to your app. Upon loading the metadata of the endpoint (such as the endpoint.json definition file), the app retrieves this information from your locally running endpoint. This setup enables you to run and test your endpoint locally, facilitate debugging, and observe its behavior within your app ecosystem, all without any additional requirements.
For a comprehensive understanding of the proxy endpoint&rsquo;s functionality, refer to the documentation page.
Endpoint registration # Once your endpoint implementation is complete, it&rsquo;s essential to register it on the platform to make it accessible to your apps. Alternatively, you can choose to make it publicly available for others to use.
Within the Developer Portal and under the Endpoints section, developers can view and manage the endpoints under their purview. This section allows you to register new endpoints, update existing ones, or disable them as needed.
When registering a new endpoint, you&rsquo;ll need to provide the following information:
Label: A user-friendly name for the endpoint. Name: A unique name for the endpoint, which must match the name used in the endpoint.json definition file. Note that the name cannot be modified later. Repository: The Git URL of the repository containing the endpoint&rsquo;s code. The repository must be public. If it&rsquo;s private, we currently support only GitHub repositories, and you&rsquo;ll need to grant read access to the user slingr-builder. The URL should be in SSH format, like git@github.com:workspace_id/repo_name.git. Folder: Optional field for specifying the location of the endpoint within a specific folder. Type: Choose between Java and Node.js to indicate the endpoint&rsquo;s programming language. Visibility: Select either private or public. For public visibility, any app can utilize the endpoint. For private visibility, you can specify which apps can access the endpoint. Upon registration, the endpoint is associated with the developer who registers it. However, if necessary, ownership of the endpoint can be transferred to another account using a tool available in the endpoint editing section.
After registration, the platform will automatically detect new versions of the endpoint (identified by tags with the format v1.15.1, for example). These versions are visible when viewing endpoint details, where you can perform version management tasks:
Trigger a search for new versions: Refreshes the list of available versions for the endpoint. Build a specific version: Initiates the build process for a particular version. Set a version as the latest/default: Designates a specific version as the latest or default choice. Additionally, you can change the endpoint&rsquo;s icon within its details. The icon should be in PNG format and have a size of 48x48px.
Please note that endpoints cannot be deleted; however, you can disable them, preventing their usage in any app.
Summary # To summarize, here&rsquo;s what you need to start developing your endpoint:
Begin by creating your local endpoint using either the Java SDK or the Node SDK. Next, create a proxy endpoint in your app. Configure the proxy endpoint to connect both to your local endpoint and vice versa. Develop, utilize, and test your endpoint within your app! Explore the available options for your endpoints here. Once it&rsquo;s functioning effectively, register it and generate a version of your endpoint. Integrate your endpoint into your apps! `}),e.add({id:42,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/app/global-type/",title:"Global settings",description:`In the app builder, under the App &gt; Types section, you have the capability to employ predefined type rules and display options.

This proves advantageous when you wish to maintain a consistent configuration across multiple fields in the app while managing it centrally in a single location.
By default, upon creating a new app, default display options are generated for all types. Consequently, when you create a new field, the type display options for that field are automatically configured to reference the default type display options. This approach permits subsequent modifications to the display options of all fields in one central location.
For instance, consider a scenario where your app incorporates numerous date-type fields. You decide to display the date in a distinct format. If all date fields&rsquo; display options reference the global defaults, altering the format in a single location suffices, as opposed to navigating field by field for adjustments.
It&rsquo;s worth noting that no default rules are established for type rules by default. Generally, sharing rules across all fields in the app isn&rsquo;t the norm.
Refer to the configuration of type rules and display options within fields to understand how you can link to the predefined configurations established here.
In the event that you delete a predefined configuration that is in use by other fields, the configuration for those fields will transition to Custom. Although the settings will persist, they will no longer be interconnected.

These settings form the foundation of the endpoint configuration. Below, you&rsquo;ll find a comprehensive explanation of each setting:
label: This represents the visible name assigned to the endpoint. name: The internal identifier of the endpoint, determining its endpoint type. Typically in lowercase with hyphens. apiVersion: Specifies the API version for communication with the Slingr Platform. Currently, the only valid value is v1. configurationType: Indicates whether the configuration applies per app or at the user-level. The following options are available: GLOBAL: Select this option if the endpoint configuration is exclusive to the app level (within the app builder). PER_USER: Opt for this option if, in addition to the global configuration, each user requires specific settings to establish a connection to the endpoint. For instance, this scenario applies to the Google Calendar endpoint, where users need to authorize the endpoint individually using OAuth. configurationHelpUrl: An optional URL providing documentation related to endpoint configuration. Deployment settings # ... &quot;deployment&quot;: { &quot;profiles&quot;:[ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;default&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Default&quot;, &quot;memory&quot;: 512, &quot;offHeapMinFactor&quot;: 1.5, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Default configuration&quot; } ], &quot;type&quot;: &quot;java&quot;, &quot;allowMultipleInstances&quot;: true }, ... The deployment section allows you to adjust technical options for running the component.
Within this section, you can define different profiles for a single endpoint. Essentially, a profile determines the memory allocation for the endpoint (with CPU adjustment happening automatically). The following settings are available for each profile:
name: The internal name of the endpoint. It must not contain spaces or special characters. label: The visible name of the profile, displayed to users in the app builder. memory: The amount of memory required by the endpoint. This represents the total memory utilized by the process. offHeapMinFactor (optional, exclusive to Java endpoints): This indicates the factor for non-heap memory allocation. If your endpoint requires more native memory, you might need to increase this value. The default value is at a minimum of 1. description: A description of the profile shown to developers. It should provide useful information to aid in selecting the appropriate profile. In addition to these settings, there are other configuration options available for the endpoint&rsquo;s deployment:
allowMultipleInstances: This can be set to true or false. When set to true, multiple instances of the endpoint can be configured. Requests will be distributed among instances, so the endpoint should not maintain any instance-specific state. For greater reliability, consider setting this to false, enabling it only when scaling is necessary and when instance statelessness is ensured. type: Indicates the technology used for the endpoint. This information enables the platform to perform the appropriate build for the endpoint. Possible values include: java, java8, java11, and nodejs. Descriptor file stores # ... &quot;stores&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;test_data_store&quot;, &quot;indexes&quot;: [ {&quot;fieldA&quot;: 1}, {&quot;fieldB&quot;: 1, &quot;fieldC&quot;: -1} ] } ], ... If your endpoint needs to store data persistently, you will need to define &ldquo;stores.&rdquo; In these stores, you can save JSON documents, search for them using keys, update, or remove them. It&rsquo;s similar to a simple database that you can utilize within your endpoints.
For each store, you need to define the following settings:
name: the name of the store. It cannot contain spaces or special characters. indexes: if the store is going to contain many documents, it&rsquo;s beneficial to add indexes to optimize how you access the data. You can define several indexes. For each index, you need to specify the field(s) included in the index and the direction. Use 1 for ascending and -1 for descending. Descriptor file functions # ... &quot;functions&quot;: [ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Random number generator&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;randomNumber&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Generates a random integer&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Ping&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;ping&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The service returns the sent value for the Pong event&quot;, &quot;callbacks&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;pong&quot;, &quot;maxWaitingTime&quot;: 60000, &quot;maxExpectedResponses&quot;: 1 } ] }, ... ], ... Functions are fundamental for interacting with endpoints, as they can be invoked from the app using scripts. A set of parameters is sent to the function, which is then received by the endpoint. The function can return a result. For more detailed information on how functions work, refer to the documentation.
In this scenario, you do not need to specify any parameters explicitly. The function&rsquo;s implementation will receive a JSON and should utilize the necessary parameters.
Here are the settings for a function:
label: This is the human-friendly name of the function.
name: The function&rsquo;s name. This name will be used to call the function and must match the name defined in your implementation.
description: A description of the function&rsquo;s purpose. This field is optional.
callbacks: When a function&rsquo;s execution might take a considerable amount of time, rather than blocking the caller, you can define callbacks. These callbacks will be triggered once the results are ready or when an event related to the function call occurs. Note that these callbacks need to be defined as events too, as they are essentially events tied to a function call. Refer to the documentation on endpoint callbacks for a comprehensive understanding of how they are utilized within apps.
Callbacks possess the following properties:
name: This is the callback&rsquo;s designated name to be used in the code. It should also match the event&rsquo;s name defined in the endpoint (refer to the events section below). maxWaitingTime: This indicates the maximum expected duration for the callback to be invoked since the function is triggered. Setting a reasonable waiting time is crucial, as resources will only be released after this timeout or after the callback is called (refer to the next property as well). maxExpectedResponses: By default, once the callback is called, resources are released and it won&rsquo;t be called again. However, there are situations where the callback might be triggered multiple times by a single function execution. In such cases, you should specify the maximum number of times this callback can be invoked. Descriptor file events # ... &quot;events&quot;: [ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Inbound Event&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;inboundEvent&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Event send for the endpoint each time that a POST request to the root path of the web service.&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Pong&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;pong&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Callback event for the Ping function&quot; }, ... ], ... Events originate at endpoints and are sent to the app, where they can be processed through listeners. For detailed instructions on how to process events from endpoints, refer to the documentation here.
An event&rsquo;s definition contains a few key properties. The content of the event is defined by the endpoint, and the app receives it as JSON. However, there&rsquo;s no need to define the structure here.
These are the properties of events:
label: This is the name developers will see in the app builder. name: This is the internal name of the event used for identification in the code. description: A concise explanation of what triggers this event and when it is triggered. Descriptor file configuration # Endpoints can be configured within the app builder. Typically, developers will need to enter API keys and other required settings for the endpoint to function.
There are two types of configurations that an endpoint can have:
Global configuration: This configuration is applied when you access the endpoint in the app builder. All endpoints can have this type of configuration. User configuration: Users will encounter this configuration when they navigate to My Integrations in the secondary menu of the app runtime. This configuration is specific to individual users and is only available for endpoints where the configurationType setting is defined as PER_USER. Configurations are defined at the root of the descriptor using the following structure:
... &quot;configuration&quot;:[ ... ], &quot;userConfiguration&quot;:[ ... ] Each configuration is described by a set of fields, which follow the structure outlined below:
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Field&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;field&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;password&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: true, &quot;visibility&quot;: @config.otherField, &quot;showLabel&quot;: true, &quot;defaultValue&quot;: &quot;12345678&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: {} } Here is a brief description of each property:
label: This is the label displayed on the left side of the field. It is required if showLabel is set to true (default value). name: Represents the key under which the value will be stored in the configuration. This key is also accessible through the config global variable. type: The type of the field. This determines the typeOptions field. More information about types is provided below. multiplicity: There are two possible values: one (default value) or many. The many value allows defining multiple values for this field (as an array). required: Indicates whether the field is mandatory. It can be represented with a boolean value (true or false), a reference like @config.otherField, or an expression such as config.otherField &amp;&amp; utils.isPlaceHolder(config.anotherValue). visibility: Indicates if the field is visible in the UI. It can be represented with a boolean value (true or false), a reference like @config.otherField, or an expression like config.otherField &amp;&amp; utils.isPlaceHolder(config.anotherValue). showLabel: If set to false, the label will not be displayed, and the field will use the entire available width. It is represented with a boolean value (true or false). defaultValue: The value set by default if a value has not been set by the user. typeOptions: Only valid for some types; please refer to the next section for more details. Next, we will describe the available field types:
Label # Type: label
A label represents a read-only value that will not be stored as part of the configuration. It serves as informational content for users and developers.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Simple&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;simpleLabel&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;label&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Sample Complex endpoint&quot; } This field type has no options.
Information # Type: info
This type enables the display of an alert that accommodates the insertion of HTML code.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Information&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;information&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;info&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;alertType&quot;: &quot;warning&quot; }, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Follow these points to generate a new credentials:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to the Dev Console&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create a new project. Copy the 'Project Name' in the configuration form.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot; } Options:
alertType: Describes the color or format for display. Valid values include: info, success, warning, and danger. Fields group # Type: fieldsGroup
This special type of field enables nesting other fields within it, providing a structured way to organize and group fields.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Labels&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;labels&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fieldsGroup&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;fields&quot;:[ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Simple&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;simpleLabel&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;label&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;Sample Complex endpoint&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Concatenation&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;concatenation&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;label&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: &quot;'Prefix ['+(config.entity ? config.entity : 'No entity') +'] &gt; ['+(config.entityField ? config.entityField : 'No field')+'] &gt; ['+(config.entityAction ? config.entityAction : 'No action')+']'&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Multi&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;multiLabel&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;label&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;many&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: [ &quot;config.entity ? config.entity : 'No entity'&quot;, &quot;config.entityField ? config.entityField : 'No field'&quot;, &quot;config.entityAction ? config.entityAction : 'No action'&quot; ] } ] } } Options:
fields: The structure of this field must adhere to that of configuration or userConfiguration. Essentially, it is an array of fields. While it supports any number of levels, it&rsquo;s not recommended to go beyond two levels due to limited available UI space. Text # Type: text
This input represents a standard text field where the value is stored as a simple string. It can include validations set through type options.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Email&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;email&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: true, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;validation&quot;: &quot;email&quot; } } { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Description&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;description&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;representation&quot;: &quot;textArea&quot;, &quot;numberOfRows&quot;: 4 } } Options:
validation: Available validations include: email, number, and url. All these validations allow placeholders. representation: This determines the component used to represent the field. Valid options are: inputText (default) and textArea. numberOfRows: If the selected representation is textArea, you can specify the number of rows to be displayed. Password # Type: password
This field is represented by a password input. The value will not be visible to the developer and will be stored as a plain string. Note that all endpoint settings are encrypted, as sensitive information is typically involved.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Password&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;password&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;password&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: true } This field type has no options.
Toggle # Type: toggle
Creates a toggle widget and will store a boolean value.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Sync Automatically&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;syncAutomatically&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;toggle&quot; } This field type has no options.
Script # Type: script
This field can store a script (JavaScript) that can be utilized later in the app.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Action Script&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;actionScript&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;script&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;parameters&quot;: [&quot;day&quot;, &quot;amount&quot;] } } You can invoke this script during runtime using the following approach:
app.endpoints.sampleEndpoint.config.actionScript({day: '2019-02-15', amount: 5}); Options:
params: A list of parameters that this function will accept. Only these parameters will be passed to the function when it is executed. Button # Type: button
This component allows the execution of an action when clicked. No information is stored as value of this field. This component does not allow multiplicity equals to many.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Set email&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;setEmail&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;button&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;color&quot;: &quot;info&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;if (!config.inputs.email) { config.inputs.email = 'test1@slingr.io'; }&quot; } } Options:
color: The available values are info, default, primary, success, warning, and danger. action: This is an expression that will be parsed and executed as a JavaScript function on the client side. Some interesting examples can be found in the official endpoints. For instance, the Google Calendar endpoint uses buttons to trigger the OAuth process. Buttons group # Type: buttonsGroup
This component creates a group of buttons. If multiplicity is set to true, multiple values can be selected.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Multi&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;multiSwitcher&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;buttonsGroup&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;many&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: true, &quot;defaultValue&quot;: [&quot;danger&quot;, &quot;info&quot;], &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;possibleValues&quot;:[ { &quot;label&quot;:&quot;Danger&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;danger&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;:&quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;warn&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;:&quot;Information&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;info&quot; } ], &quot;allowCustom&quot;: true } } Options:
possibleValues: This is an array of elements with label (text shown as options) and name (string stored as value). These elements constitute the available options. allowCustom: Indicates whether a placeholder can be set as a value, creating an input right next to the buttons for selection. This feature is important if the value of this field might need to vary across different environments of your app. Drop-down # Type: dropDown
This component creates a combo box. In the case of multiplicity being set to many, more than one value can be selected.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Multi Custom&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;multiCustomDropDown&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;dropDown&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;many&quot;, &quot;defaultValue&quot;: [&quot;\${TEST2}&quot;, &quot;CA&quot;], &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;allowCustom&quot;: true, &quot;possibleValues&quot;:[ { &quot;label&quot;:&quot;New York&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;NY&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;:&quot;Arizona&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;AZ&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;:&quot;California&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;CA&quot; } ] } } Options:
possibleValues: This is an array of elements with label (text shown as options) and name (string stored as value). These elements constitute the available options. allowCustom: Indicates whether a placeholder can be set as a value, creating an input next to buttons for selection. This feature is important if the value of this field might need to change between different environments of your app. Entity # Type: entity
This component allows the selection of an existing entity defined within the app. The value will be stored as a reference to metadata and will be updated accordingly when changes occur. For instance, if the entity&rsquo;s name changes, the configuration of the endpoint will be automatically updated. Similarly, if the entity is deleted, the value will be cleared.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Entity&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entity&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;entity&quot; } This field type has no options.
Entity field # Type: entityField
Allows to select an existing entity field. The value will be stored as a reference to metadata, being refactored in the same way when changes happen. For example, if the entity field&rsquo;s name changes, the configuration of the endpoint will be updated, or if the field gets deleted, the value will be cleared.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Field&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entityField&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;entityField&quot;, &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot;, &quot;required&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;entity&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot;, &quot;filterTypes&quot;: [&quot;user&quot;, &quot;choice&quot;] } } Options:
entity: This option specifies the entity to which the field should belong. Valid values include the entity name or ID, or a direct reference like @config.entity. filterTypes: This option accepts a list of valid entity field types (in camel case) to filter the types of fields listed in the selector. Entity action # Type: entityAction
Allows the selection of an existing entity action. The value will be stored as a metadata reference, which will be updated in the same way when changes occur. For instance, if the entity action&rsquo;s name is modified, the configuration of the endpoint will be updated accordingly. Similarly, if the action is deleted, the value will be cleared.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Action&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entityAction&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;entityAction&quot;, &quot;visibility&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot;, &quot;defaultValue&quot;: &quot;addANote&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;entity&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot; } } Options:
entity: This option specifies the entity to which the action should belong. Valid values include the entity name or ID, or a direct reference like @config.entity. Entity filters # Type: entityFilters
Allows developers to define an entity filter while configuring the endpoint. The value will be stored as metadata, meaning it will be updated if fields involved in this filter are renamed or deleted.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Filters&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entityFilters&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;entityFilters&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;entity&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot; }, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;_or&quot;: { &quot;companyType&quot;:&quot;Self&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;notEmpty()&quot; }, &quot;entity&quot;:&quot;companies&quot; } } The value is represented as complex queries. For more information, please refer to the documentation on expressions to understand how it works and how to use it in a query.
Options:
entity: This option specifies the entity associated with the filter. Valid values include the entity name or ID, or a direct reference like @config.entity. Entity events # Type: entityEvents
Allows the developer to define an entity event while configuring the endpoint. The value will be stored as metadata, which means it will be refactored, for example, if fields involved in this event are renamed or deleted.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Events&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;entityEvents&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;entityEvents&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;entity&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot; }, &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;events&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;59b029ad57abd274c50074c6&quot;, &quot;conditionType&quot;:&quot;none&quot;, &quot;type&quot;:&quot;recordCreated&quot;, &quot;sourceEvents&quot;: [ &quot;userEvents&quot;, &quot;systemEvents&quot; ] }, { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;59b02a604b31a11b77001b78&quot;, &quot;conditionType&quot;:&quot;expression&quot;, &quot;expression&quot;: { &quot;filters&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;:&quot;byValue&quot;, &quot;operation&quot;:&quot;notEmpty&quot;, &quot;field&quot;:&quot;companyLinks.link&quot;, &quot;values&quot;:[] } ], &quot;entity&quot;:&quot;companies&quot; }, &quot;type&quot;:&quot;conditionMet&quot;, &quot;sourceEvents&quot;: [ &quot;userEvents&quot;, &quot;systemEvents&quot; ] }, { &quot;id&quot;:&quot;59b02bf7bdcf466302006303&quot;, &quot;conditionType&quot;:&quot;script&quot;, &quot;script&quot;: &quot;1 == '1'&quot;, &quot;type&quot;:&quot;actionPerformed&quot;, &quot;actions&quot;: [ &quot;assignCompanyType&quot;, &quot;addANote&quot; ], &quot;sourceEvents&quot;: [ &quot;scriptEvents&quot;, &quot;systemEvents&quot; ] } ] } } This events can be used later to define listeners.
Options:
entity: this is the entity the event is associated with. Valid values are the entity name or id, or a direct reference like @config.entity. Entity mapper # Type: entityMapper
The entity mapper field type assists in defining a mapping between the app and the endpoint. For instance, consider a scenario where the endpoint integrates with a service that holds information about companies. Instead of requiring users to manually establish a mapping between the companies in the external service and the entities in the app, the entity mapper can be utilized to configure the mapping process. Subsequently, the endpoint will utilize this configured information to automate the mapping procedure.
{ &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Accounts&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;accounts&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;entityMapper&quot;, &quot;typeOptions&quot;: { &quot;allowToCreateEntity&quot;: true, &quot;allowToSelectDirection&quot;: true, &quot;recordNameField&quot;: &quot;name&quot;, &quot;fields&quot;: [ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;name&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Type&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;type&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;choice&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;options&quot;: { &quot;possibleValues&quot;: [ {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Client&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;client&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Prospect&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;prospect&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Other&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;other&quot;} ] } }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Relationship&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;relation&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;relationship&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;options&quot;: { &quot;entity&quot;: &quot;@config.entity&quot; } }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Address&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;address&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;nestedFields&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;options&quot;: { &quot;nestedFields&quot;: [ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Streets&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;streets&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;many&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;State&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;state&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;choice&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot;, &quot;options&quot;: { &quot;possibleValues&quot;: [ {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Arizona&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;AZ&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;NY&quot;}, {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;California&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;CA&quot;} ] } }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Contact&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;contact&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;nestedFields&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;many&quot;, &quot;options&quot;: { &quot;nestedFields&quot;: [ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Name&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;name&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;text&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;one&quot; }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Phones&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;phones&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;phone&quot;, &quot;multiplicity&quot;: &quot;many&quot; } ] } } ] } } ], &quot;hooks&quot;: [ { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Syncing to app&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;syncingToApp&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: [&quot;record&quot;, &quot;oldRecord&quot;, &quot;data&quot;] }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Syncing to Endpoint&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;syncingEndpoint&quot;, &quot;params&quot;: [&quot;record&quot;, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;other&quot;] }, { &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Other script&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;otherScript&quot; } ] } } Options:
allowToCreateEntity: If set to true, a Create entity button will appear, allowing developers to create an entity with the configuration described in the mapper. A popup will be displayed to insert label and name. If the process completes successfully, the popup will close, and the configuration will be automatically populated with entity information. This feature greatly speeds up the integration process. For instance, a Google Calendar endpoint could have a mapper for events. Instead of manually creating the entity, users could click on Create entity to automatically generate the entity and configure it to sync with events in Google Calendar.
WARNING: If the configuration has dependencies on other fields, such as relationship fields pointing to an entity, and these dependencies are not set at the moment of triggering the create operation, the creation process will fail, showing a validation error. allowToSelectDirection: If set to true, a button group will be displayed, allowing the selection of one of three possible values:
App to Endpoint: Changes in the app are synchronized to the endpoint. Endpoint to App: Changes on the endpoint side must be synced to the Slingr app. Both: If allowToSelectDirection is false, the defaultDirection field is required. defaultDirection: This field indicates the default synchronization direction. It can be set to appTolegacyService, endpointToApp, or both.
recordNameField: Specifies which of the root fields will be used in the entity as the record name. This value is only used when clicking the Create entity button.
fields: This list includes the fields that can be mapped. Mandatory fields are label, name, and type. The multiplicity is optional, with a default value of one.
For types choice, relationship, and nestedFields, the options object is required to specify possibleValues, entity, and nestedFields, respectively. All these configurations are necessary for entity creation. Furthermore, they function as filters when an entity is selected through a combo-box, filtering valid fields for each configuration. Values are stored as references to entities and will be sent to the endpoint as paths of fields. hooks: Hooks mainly consist of script fields that will be available for endpoints. Here, users can describe function headers and the behavior when mapping alone is insufficient to convert fields from one side to the other.
Scripts # You need to configure scripts in the descriptor file:
... &quot;scripts&quot;:[ &quot;sample.js&quot;, &quot;other.js&quot; ], ... Scripts should be placed in the scripts folder of your endpoint, and the names of the files need to match the ones in the descriptor.
These scripts are provided by the endpoint and are executed in the context of the app, similar to other scripts. For instance, they are similar to scripts in libraries. These scripts serve to streamline the usage of the endpoint or offer certain features that should be executed on the app side.
Here are some common usages of scripts in endpoints:
Wrappers for endpoints functions: For instance, wrappers can be used to simplify the exposure of functions. These wrappers may perform actions to present the function in a more straightforward manner. Look at this sample: endpoint.wrapperFunc = function(a, b, c) { endpoint.func({a: a, b: b, c: c}); } In the example provided above, the user is not required to send a map when calling the function, but can directly pass the parameters. Access to app data: In cases where you need to automate a process requiring access to app data, execution on the app side is necessary. This is because querying app data is not possible from within the endpoint. A script file will look like this:
var s = function(a, b){ return a+b; }; endpoint.sum = s; endpoint.rnd = function(){ return Math.random(); }; endpoint.PI_VALUE = Math.PI; endpoint.rndSum = function(){ return this.sum(this.rnd(), this.PI_VALUE); }; endpoint.showConfig = function(){ sys.logs.info(&quot;Endpoint: &quot;+this._name); sys.logs.info(&quot; - Token: &quot;+this._configuration.token); // check that the variable 'endpoint' is isolated on the context sys.logs.info(&quot; - Token (by ref): &quot;+endpoint._configuration.token); }; In this context, there is a special variable called endpoint. You can add properties to this object to make them accessible within the endpoint. For instance, in the example mentioned above, you could invoke the function rnd by using the syntax app.endpoints.sample.rnd() (assuming your endpoint&rsquo;s name is sample).
It&rsquo;s also important to note the following elements:
endpoint._name: This represents the name of the endpoint configured in the app. endpoint._configuration: This is a map containing the configuration of the endpoint. Listeners # Listeners need to be defined in the descriptor file:
... &quot;listeners&quot;:[ &quot;dataListener.js&quot;, &quot;jobListener.js&quot;, &quot;endpointListener.js&quot; ], ... These scripts should be located in the listeners folder of the endpoint.
Within these scripts, you can dynamically define listeners. This way, when developers integrate an endpoint into their apps, listeners will be automatically incorporated.
For instance, you could utilize this feature to enable automatic data synchronization between the app and an external service. In this scenario, you would create a listener that triggers when a record is modified in the app, facilitating the synchronization of changes to the external service. Similarly, you could establish another listener to respond to incoming webhooks from the external app, ensuring that the data in the app remains updated.
To define listeners, you should add them as properties to the listeners object:
var getEntity = function(){ return 'companies'; }; listeners.listenerForCompaniesChanges = { label: 'Listener for Companies changes', type: 'data', options: { executeInBackground: true, entity: getEntity(), events: [ { type: 'recordCreated' }, {type: 'actionPerformed', action: 'assignCompanyType'} ] }, callback: function(event, record, oldRecord) { sys.logs.info('Entering to listener handler'); sys.logs.info('Event: '+JSON.stringify(event)); sys.logs.info('Record: '+JSON.stringify(record)); sys.logs.info('Old record: '+(oldRecord ? JSON.stringify(oldRecord) : '')); } }; The script can contain its own functions, such as getEntity. The name of the variable will be the name of the listener. Additionally, the user needs to configure the label of the listener, followed by the type (which can be data, endpoint, or job). The options field pertains to the specific configuration for each type. Finally, the callback defines the action executed by the listener. The header of this function is ignored; only the internal code is utilized. Developers must consider the parameters based on the listener type. Refer to the documentation for more details.
Next, we will provide a brief overview of the different types of listeners:
Data # Refer to the example below:
listeners.listenerForCompaniesChanges = { //The name will be taken from this namespace label: 'Listener for Companies changes', //label configuration type: 'data', options: { executeInBackground: true, //Indicates if the listener must be executed in background entity: 'companies', //The name or id of the entity listened events: [ //entity events configuration {type: 'recordCreated'}, //the type of entity event, it can be 'recordCreated', 'recordChanged', 'recordDeleted', 'actionPerformed' {type: 'actionPerformed', action: 'assignCompanyType'} //not all event types are available, in addition, for 'actionPerformed' the name or id can be specify ] }, callback: function(event, record, oldRecord) {// available parameters are 'event', 'record' and 'oldRecord' sys.logs.info('Entering to listener handler'); //JS API functions are available sys.logs.info('Event: '+JSON.stringify(event)); sys.logs.info('Record: '+JSON.stringify(record)); sys.logs.info('Old record: '+(oldRecord ? JSON.stringify(oldRecord) : '')); } }; Endpoint # See the example:
listeners.listenerForSample = { //The name will be taken from this namespace label: 'Listener for Sample endpoint', //label configuration type: 'endpoint', options: { endpoint: endpoint.name, //name of listened endpoint, it can be taken for special var called \`endpoint\` referring to current endpoint event: 'inboundEvent' //a valid event defined into \`endpoint.json\` dispatched by selected endpoint }, callback: function(event) {// only \`event\` is a available parameter for this function sys.logs.info('Entering to listener handler'); //JS API functions are available sys.logs.info('Event: '+JSON.stringify(event)); } }; Job # See the example:
listeners.listenerForExportRecords = { //The name will be taken from this namespace label: 'Listener for Export records', //label configuration type: 'job', options: { jobType: 'exportRecords',//job type, available are: \`startApp\`, \`stopApp\`, \`importRecords\`, \`exportRecords\`, \`importUsers\`, \`exportUsers\` event: 'finished'// status listened, available are: \`created\`, \`started\`, \`finished\`, \`stopped\`, \`resumed\`, and \`canceled\` }, callback: function(event) {// only \`event\` is a available parameter for this function sys.logs.info('Entering to listener handler'); //JS API functions are available sys.logs.info('Event: '+JSON.stringify(event)); } }; Flow steps # You have the ability to create customized flow steps for your endpoint. To achieve this, define the endpoint&rsquo;s flow steps in the descriptor file:
... &quot;flowSteps&quot;: [ &quot;numberGenerator&quot;, &quot;weatherService&quot;, &quot;simpleCalculator&quot; ], ... Flow steps should be defined in the flowSteps folder of your endpoint, and the names of the files must match those in the descriptor. For each defined flow step, you need to provide three files:
icon.png: This is the icon representing the step in the flow editor. step.js: This file should contain the function that will be executed as part of the step. The function must receive a unique object parameter called &lsquo;inputs&rsquo;, which contains the function parameters. step.json: This file should contain the name of the step, along with its inputs and outputs. After creating these necessary files, you&rsquo;ll need to register your endpoint with a new version. Additional details can be found in the Endpoint Registration section.
Upon registering the new endpoint version and selecting that new version from the developer portal, the newly defined flow steps will be accessible in the flow editor.
Steps available in the flow editor Required files examples # Examples for step.js file:
/** * Generates a random number. * * @param {object} inputs {number} bound, This is used to get a random number between 0 (inclusive) and the number * passed in this argument, exclusive. */ step.numberGenerator = function (inputs) { var data = endpoint.randomNumber({bound: inputs.bound}); return { &quot;generatedNumber&quot;: data['number'] }; }; /** * Returns some real time weather characteristics given a city * * @param {object} inputs {string} city, City name, if nothing found it will use a default city (NY) */ step.weatherService = function (inputs) { var data = endpoint.weather({city: inputs.city}); return { &quot;city&quot;: data['city'], &quot;temperature&quot;: data['temperature'], &quot;pressure&quot;: data['pressure'], &quot;humidity&quot;: data['humidity'] }; }; From the step.js file, you can invoke JavaScript functions defined in the script files under the scripts folder, as well as functions annotated with @LegacyServiceFunction. The object you return from the step.js function should align with the output structure defined in the step.json file.
Here are examples for the step.json file:

You can also explore our sample endpoints to understand the features available in the Slingr integrations framework:
Sample Endpoint Sample User Endpoint Sample Complex Endpoint Additionally, take a look at the HTTP Endpoint since most endpoints interact with HTTP REST APIs, and this endpoint covers the basic features. You can also see how endpoints like Sparkpost utilize these features.
While you can start from scratch, we recommend using the skeleton endpoint to get up and running quickly.
Customize the skeleton template # If you&rsquo;ve used the skeleton endpoint, there are a few adjustments you might want to make:
POM file # The pom.xml contains several elements you might want to adjust:
groupId: This specifies your endpoint&rsquo;s group, which could be your company&rsquo;s group. artifactId: This typically represents your endpoint&rsquo;s name for Maven. version: This is your endpoint&rsquo;s version. You can leave it as 1.0-SNAPSHOT since Slingr uses repository tags for versioning. name: This is a human-readable name for your endpoint. properties &gt; build.main-class: If you modify the package of the main class io.sliongr.endpoints.skeleton.SkeletonLegacyService (which you probably will), update it to match the package (except for the class Runner). For example, if your endpoint&rsquo;s main class is yourcompany.endpoints.LegacyEndpoint, update it to yourcompany.endpoints.Runner. Endpoint descriptor # The endpoint.json file has at least two fields to update:
label: This is a user-friendly endpoint name. name: This is the internal endpoint name used for registration in Slingr. For other settings, refer to the Endpoint Features documentation.
Main class name # You&rsquo;ll likely want to rename and repackage the io.slingr.endpoints.skeleton.SkeletonEndpoint class, which is your endpoint&rsquo;s main class.
Additionally, update the @SlingrEndpoint annotation:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;name&quot;) public class SkeletonEndpoint extends Endpoint { } Ensure that this name matches the corresponding entry in endpoints.json.
Reading configuration # There are two ways to retrieve configuration settings from the endpoint:
Define individual fields Access the entire configuration using a Json object To define individual variables, follow this syntax within the class annotated with @SlingrEndpoint:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;name&quot;) public class SkeletonEndpoint extends Endpoint { @EndpointProperty private String token; } To store the value of the configuration property token, assign it to the variable token. Conventionally, the variable name matches the field name. However, you can customize it using the name attribute within the @EndpointProperty annotation.
Additionally, you have the option to utilize the @EndpointConfiguration annotation in the following manner:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;name&quot;) public class SkeletonEndpoint extends Endpoint { @EndpointConfiguration private Json config; @Override public void endpointStarted() { logger.info(String.format(&quot;Domain [%s]&quot;, config.string(&quot;domain&quot;))); } } Hooks # Within endpoints, several hooks are available for executing initialization or cleanup tasks.
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;name&quot;) public class SkeletonEndpoint extends Endpoint { @Override public void endpointConfigured() { // the definitions and properties are ready to be used at this point } @Override public void endpointsServicesConfigured() { // the communication with the app is ready at this point } @Override public void webServicesConfigured() { // the web services server is ready at this point } @Override public void endpointStarted() { // the endpoint has been started completely } @Override public void endpointStopped(String cause) { // endpoint has been stopped } } Functions # To implement a function defined in the endpoint.json file, employ the @SlingrFunction annotation:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;sample&quot;) public class SampleEndpoint extends Endpoint { @EndpointFunction(name = &quot;randomNumber&quot;) public Json generateRandomNumber(Json data){ Json res = Json.map(); if (data != null &amp;&amp; data.contains(&quot;max&quot;)) { res.set(&quot;number&quot;, random.nextInt(data.integer(&quot;max&quot;))); } else { res.set(&quot;number&quot;, random.nextInt(10000)); } return res; } } Upon usage, your function will receive a Json argument containing the parameters sent to the function. Your function is expected to return a Json object as the response.
Events # Utilize the Events interface to dispatch events to the app, which can be accessed through the events() method:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;sample&quot;) public class SampleEndpoint extends Endpoint { @EndpointWebService(methods = {RestMethod.POST}) private WebServiceResponse inboundEvent(WebServiceRequest request) { events().send(&quot;inboundEvent&quot;, Json.map().set(&quot;data&quot;, request.getJsonBody())); return new WebServiceResponse(); } } Note that the event inboundEvent must be defined in your endpoint.json descriptor.
When dispatching events using send(), it&rsquo;s important to note that the process is asynchronous. If you require a response from the app and wish to wait for it, employ sendSync() instead:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;sample&quot;) public class SampleEndpoint extends Endpoint { @EndpointWebService(methods = {RestMethod.POST}) private WebServiceResponse inboundEvent(WebServiceRequest request) { Object res = events().sendSync(&quot;inboundEvent&quot;, Json.map().set(&quot;data&quot;, request.getJsonBody())); // do something with the res return new WebServiceResponse(); } } Remember that, in this scenario, to obtain a response, the listener in the app should utilize the keyword return to send back the desired response.
Data stores # For endpoints requiring data persistence, data stores are accessible. These stores should be defined in the descriptor file, after which they can be utilized within the endpoint:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;sample&quot;) public class SampleEndpoint extends Endpoint { @EndpointDataStore(name = &quot;test_data_store&quot;) private DataStore dataStore; @EndpointWebService(methods = {RestMethod.POST}) private WebServiceResponse processItems(WebServiceRequest request) { Json body = request.getJsonBody(); Json query = Json.map().set(&quot;code&quot;, body.string(&quot;code&quot;)); Json item = dataStore.findOne(query); if (item == null) { item = body; dataStore.save(item); } events().send(&quot;items&quot;, item); return new WebServiceResponse(); } } Webhooks # To enable your endpoint to receive HTTP calls, you can achieve this effortlessly by using the @EndpointWebService annotation:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;sample&quot;) public class SampleEndpoint extends Endpoint { @EndpointWebService(methods = {RestMethod.POST}) private WebServiceResponse genericCommand(WebServiceRequest request) { // do something with the res return new WebServiceResponse(); } @EndpointWebService(path = &quot;/orders&quot;, methods = {RestMethod.POST}) private WebServiceResponse processOrder(WebServiceRequest request) { // do something here return new WebServiceResponse(); } } Given the above sample, the following URLs will be available:
POST https://&lt;yourAppName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/endpoints/&lt;endpointName&gt; POST https://&lt;yourAppName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/endpoints/&lt;endpointName&gt;/orders When those URLs are called, those methods will be invoked.
You should always add some kind of verification (like a token) to avoid anyone calling your endpoints. Handling files # It is possible to upload and download files to/from the app using the utilities in \`\`
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;sample&quot;) public class SampleEndpoint extends Endpoint { @ApplicationLogger private AppLogs appLogger; @EndpointFunction public Json test1(Json data){ DownloadedFile file = files().download(data.string(&quot;fileId&quot;)); // do something with the file } @EndpointFunction public Json test2(Json data) throws IOException { Json uploadedFileInfo = files().upload(&quot;test&quot;, IOUtils.toInputStream(data.toString(), &quot;UTF-8&quot;), &quot;application/json&quot;); return uploadedFileInfo; } } Logging # It is possible to send logs to the app from your endpoint using the AppLogs:
@SlingrEndpoint(name = &quot;sample&quot;) public class SampleEndpoint extends Endpoint { @ApplicationLogger private AppLogs appLogger; @EndpointWebService(methods = {RestMethod.POST}) private WebServiceResponse genericCommand(WebServiceRequest request) { appLogger.info(&quot;Generic command arrived&quot;, request.getJsonBody()); // do something with the res return new WebServiceResponse(); } @EndpointWebService(path = &quot;/orders&quot;, methods = {RestMethod.POST}) private WebServiceResponse processOrder(WebServiceRequest request) { appLogger.info(&quot;Order processing arrived&quot;, request.getJsonBody()); // do something here return new WebServiceResponse(); } } In addition to sending a message, you have the option to include supplementary information that will be viewable by clicking on More Info within the app monitor log.
Setting up a proxy endpoint # Before proceeding to run your endpoint locally, it&rsquo;s essential to configure a proxy endpoint in the app you intend to use for testing your endpoint&rsquo;s development. Further details about this can be found in the guide: Create your own endpoints.
Upon adding a new Proxy endpoint to your app, you will be prompted to provide the Endpoint URI in the configuration. We recommend employing ngrok as an alternative to opening a port on your router. With ngrok, you can establish a URI as follows:
./ngrok http 10000 This will provide you with both an HTTP and HTTPS URL. We highly recommend utilizing the HTTPS URL; therefore, copy it and paste it into your endpoint&rsquo;s configuration.
As for the token, we suggest retaining the auto-generated token, unless you have a specific reason not to.
After creating the endpoint, you will encounter a configuration section similar to the following:
_endpoint_name=proxy _app_name=yourtestapp _environment=dev _pod_id=id _profile=default _custom_domain= _debug=true _local_deployment=true _base_domain=slingrs.io _webservices_port=10000 _endpoints_services_api=https://yourtestapp.slingrs.io/dev/endpoints/proxy/api _token=91833a8b-929f-4eab-b7b4-2383c10cd629 _endpoint_config={} Copy and paste this configuration into the endpoints.properties file. Please note that the final property, _endpoint_config, should contain valid JSON configuration for your endpoint. You may want to avoid overwriting this property. If you&rsquo;ve utilized the skeleton endpoint, your configuration might resemble the following:
_endpoint_name=proxy _app_name=yourtestapp _environment=dev _pod_id=id _profile=default _custom_domain= _debug=true _local_deployment=true _base_domain=slingrs.io _webservices_port=10000 _endpoints_services_api=https://yourtestapp.slingrs.io/dev/endpoints/proxy/api _token=91833a8b-929f-4eab-b7b4-2383c10cd629 _endpoint_config={&quot;token&quot;:&quot;123456&quot;} If you prefer, an alternative approach is to utilize a separate file if you wish to avoid committing sensitive credentials to your repository. We typically employ endpoint_proxy.properties for this purpose, which is already included in the .gitignore of the skeleton endpoint. You can provide this file as an argument when executing your endpoint. Consequently, this configuration will be utilized when your endpoint runs with the proxy.
Please bear in mind that endpoint.properties is exclusively used when you locally run the endpoint. It&rsquo;s valuable as a foundation for creating endpoint_proxy.properties. However, it doesn&rsquo;t impact the endpoint&rsquo;s behavior in the cloud since endpoint configuration is managed differently.
Once the proxy endpoint has been established in your app, remember to commit and push changes to ensure proper initialization.
Running your endpoint # Before you proceed with running your endpoint, ensure that you have built it:
cd ENDPOINT_FOLDER mvn package You can proceed to run your endpoint either through the command line or using your Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Ensure that you provide the following details when launching:
Main Class: Set this to package.Runner, where package corresponds to the configuration you established when creating the endpoint. You can find the class path within the pom.xml file. Configuration File: Specify the properties file to use. Typically, this will be endpoints.properties, endpoints_proxy.properties, or any other designated properties file. VM Options: Optionally, you can define the heap size using -Xmx256M. This helps restrict the memory usage of your endpoint, minimizing potential issues upon deployment to the cloud. Keep in mind that this memory setting doesn&rsquo;t precisely mirror the memory available when the endpoint is deployed in the cloud. Total memory consumption includes native memory used by the entire process. Nevertheless, limiting heap memory can be beneficial. Working Directory: Confirm that the working directory aligns with the location of your endpoint&rsquo;s code. Using Maven, you can execute the command below in the root folder of your endpoint:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=&quot;io.slingr.endpoints.skeleton.Runner&quot; -Dexec.args=&quot;configurationFile=endpoint_proxy.properties&quot; -DROOT_LOGGER=stdout Testing that your endpoint is working # NWith your endpoint operational and the proxy endpoint established, let&rsquo;s perform a brief test to confirm that everything is functioning correctly. To carry out this test, execute the provided code within your builder or monitor console:
var res = app.endpoints.proxy.randomNumber({}); log('res: '+JSON.stringify(res)); You should see an output like this:
res: {&quot;number&quot;:5560} We are making the assumption that you are utilizing the skeleton endpoint template, which includes the availability of this method. Alternatively, if you're not using the skeleton template, ensure that you call a method that exists within your own endpoint.

This signifies that they are synchronized to the production environment. It&rsquo;s prudent to confine the usage of this space to relatively small files that might be required. Excessive reliance on this mechanism can potentially decelerate the process of syncing changes. For substantial files, such as videos, it&rsquo;s recommended to explore alternative storage services.
While every new app comes with three default folders (documents, images, and misc), you have the flexibility to organize files according to your specific requirements. This is achievable through the creation or modification of folders.

This is essential for adjusting app behavior, as the app builder is not accessible in the production environment. Centralized Value Management: Altering the value of an environment variable requires changes in just one place. In contrast, hard-coded values necessitate manual updates across the entire app. To manage environment variables, you can access the dedicated section within the app builder: Environment settings &gt; Environment variables. Alternatively, these variables can also be managed via the app monitor: Environment settings &gt; Environment variables.
Synchronization of environment variables # Upon creation, environment variables are typically designated as &ldquo;synced.&rdquo; This implies that if a variable&rsquo;s value is modified in the development environment, the change will be mirrored in the production environment during the synchronization of changes.
While this synchronization approach is beneficial when a uniform configuration is desired for both development and production, it might not suit scenarios where distinct values are needed. In such cases, the option to disable &ldquo;Keep in sync&rdquo; can be exercised. This is executed within the app monitor of the production environment. Once toggled, syncing changes from development to production will no longer overwrite the variable&rsquo;s value.
Harnessing environment variables # The utility of environment variables spans across various sections of your app&rsquo;s metadata. These variables should be enclosed using the following syntax: \${ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME}. For instance, if your variable is named ADMIN_EMAIL, referencing it would involve using \${ADMIN_EMAIL}.
For instance, if you possess an environment variable named TOKEN, its value can be integrated into a script in the following manner:
var token = '\${TOKEN}'; sys.logs.info('token: '+token); Another frequent scenario involves the utilization of environment variables within the settings of an legacy service. This approach offers a dynamic and adaptable means of configuration. For instance, when configuring a Slack legacy service, rather than embedding the bot token directly, an environment variable can be employed for enhanced flexibility. In the legacy service settings, the following syntax can be utilized (assuming the environment variable is named SLACK_BOT_TOKEN):
\${SLACK_BOT_TOKEN} System environment variables # System environment variables are automatically accessible across all apps. These variables possess calculated values designed to enhance app functionality. The following system variables are available:
APP_NAME: Reflects the name of the app. APP_ENV: Specifies the current execution environment of the app. This can be either dev (development) or prod (production). APP_URL: Provides the URL required for accessing the app runtime. For example, the URL might resemble https://app.slingrs.io/prod/runtime. APP_VERSION: A numerical identifier indicating the version of the app. This value is represented in milliseconds since the Epoch, corresponding to the moment changes were pushed. Consequently, this version number changes each time new changes are pushed. `}),e.add({id:49,href:"/slingrDoc/extending/extending-platform/node-sdk/",title:"Node SDK",description:`Create your new endpoint project # To streamline the creation of a new endpoint, we offer a sample GitHub repository containing a skeleton endpoint.

Accessing configuration settings # You can access the endpoint configuration using the following code snippet (always within a function):
endpoint.functions.someFunction = (endpointRequest) =&gt; { const configs = endpoint.endpointConfig; //your code... } Hooks # Endpoints provide a variety of hooks that allow you to execute initializations or perform cleanup tasks.
endpoint.hooks.onConfigurationReady = () =&gt; { //Some code here... } endpoint.hooks.onEndpointServicesConfigured = () =&gt; { //Some code here... } endpoint.hooks.onWebServicesReady = () =&gt; { //Some code here... } endpoint.hooks.onEndpointStart = () =&gt; { //Some code here... } //This one receives a 'cause' parameter which is the 'code' of the process.on('beforeExit') event endpoint.hooks.onEndpointStop = (cause) =&gt; { //Some code here... } Functions # To implement a function defined in the endpoint.json file, follow these steps:
endpoint.functions.yourFunctionName = (endpointRequest) =&gt; { //You can access all the endpoint services here like endpoint.endpointConfig or endpoint.dataStores //Your custom code goes here... return { someInfo: 'someValue'} } When implementing an endpoint function, it will receive a request parameter containing the function&rsquo;s parameters along with other relevant information. Remember, it&rsquo;s essential to always return a Json object as a response.
Events # Sending events to the app is accomplished through the use of the events property within the endpoint. Depending on your requirements, you can dispatch either an asynchronous event or a synchronous event if you anticipate a response from the app:
endpoint.functions.fnThatSendsAsyncEvent = (endpointRequest) =&gt; { const requestId = endpointRequest.id; //Later in your code... endpoints.events.send('someEventName', data, requestId); } endpoint.functions.fnThatSendsSyncEvent = (endpointRequest) =&gt; { const requestId = endpointRequest.id; //Later in your code... let eventResponse = endpoints.events.sendSync('someEventName', data, requestId); //Do something with that response... } Note: Ensure that the event named 'someEventName' is specified within your endpoint.json file under the events property. The data argument within the event will carry the data you intend to receive.
Additionally, the requestId parameter, as illustrated in the previous example, can be obtained from the request parameter defined in the respective function.
Data stores # For endpoints requiring persistent data storage, data stores are at your disposal. Definition of these stores takes place within the endpoint.json file, enabling their subsequent utilization within the endpoint.
The subsequent methods offer access to the various data stores:
endpoints.functions.someFunction = async () =&gt; { //Find documents by some flter: Filter here is the same as the one in sys.data.find(). eg: {someField: 'someValue'} endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.find(filter); endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.findOne(filter); //Find document by id: endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.findById('documentId'); //Save a document: Some object will be any javascript object. endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.save(someObject); //Update a document: endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.update('documentId',someObject); //Remove documents by filter: endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.remove(filter); //Remove by id: endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.removeById('documentId',someObject); //Count the documents currently saved in the store by filter: endpoints.dataStores.someDataStore.count(filter); } You have the option to either await the response or employ the then() block, depending on your specific requirements.
Web services # To enable your endpoint to accept HTTP calls, you can specify these calls using the webServices property. It&rsquo;s essential to define this property as an object containing the webservice&rsquo;s method, path, and handler:
endpoint.webServices.nameForYourWebService = { method: 'POST', path: '/', //As this is an express endpoint, you receive the req, and res objects handler: (req, res) =&gt; { //Do something... and then return a response to the caller res.json({status: 'ok'}) } } Taking the provided example into account, the subsequent URL will be operational and responsive to incoming requests:
POST https://&lt;yourAppName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/endpoints/&lt;endpointName&gt; Upon invoking this URL, the associated handler will be triggered.
To ensure secure access to your endpoints, it's advisable to incorporate a form of verification, such as a token. This measure helps prevent unauthorized calls to your endpoints. File handling # The app provides utilities within the files property to facilitate the uploading and downloading of files. Depending on whether you intend to process these actions synchronously or asynchronously, you can either await the service or manage the response within the then() block. Subsequently, you can dispatch an event to the platform.
Both scenarios are illustrated below:
endpoint.functions.asyncDownloadFileFromEndpoint = async (endpointRequest) =&gt; { const file = endpointRequest.params; endpoint.files.download(file.id).then( (res) =&gt; { endpoint.logger.info('File download has completed!'); //In this case we return res.toString() because we know the file being downloaded is a .txt.

Logging # You can transmit logs from your endpoint to the app using AppLogs:
endpoint.functions.someFunctionThatLogs = (endpointRequest) =&gt; { endpoint.appLogger.debug('Function executed!') endpoint.appLogger.info('Function executed!') endpoint.appLogger.warn('Function executed!') endpoint.appLogger.error('Function executed!') } To include supplementary information that will be viewable upon clicking More Info within the app monitor logs, provide a second parameter to the appLogger functions in the following manner:
endpoint.functions.someFunctionThatLogs = (endpointRequest) =&gt; { endpoint.appLogger.debug('Function executed!',someObjectOrMessage) endpoint.appLogger.info('Function executed!',someObjectOrMessage) endpoint.appLogger.warn('Function executed!',someObjectOrMessage) endpoint.appLogger.error('Function executed!',someObjectOrMessage) } Note: Debug logs will exclusively appear within development and staging environment monitors.
Establishing a proxy endpoint # Before you can initiate the local execution of your endpoint, it&rsquo;s essential to configure a proxy endpoint within the app you intend to use for testing your endpoint&rsquo;s development. For detailed guidance, refer to Create Your Own Endpoints.
Upon adding a new Proxy endpoint to your app, you will be prompted to input the Endpoint URI within the configuration. We recommend utilizing ngrok in lieu of opening a port on your router. Through ngrok, you can configure a URI as demonstrated below:
./ngrok http 10000 This will provide both an HTTP and an HTTPS URL. Opt for the HTTPS URL, as it&rsquo;s more secure. Copy this HTTPS URL into your endpoint&rsquo;s configuration.
Regarding the token, we advise retaining the automatically generated token, unless you possess a specific reason to opt otherwise.
Upon creating the endpoint, you will encounter a configuration similar to the example below:
_endpoint_name=proxy _app_name=yourtestapp _environment=dev _pod_id=id _profile=default _custom_domain= _debug=true _local_deployment=true _base_domain=slingrs.io _webservices_port=10000 _endpoints_services_api=https://yourtestapp.slingrs.io/dev/endpoints/proxy/api _token=91833a8b-929f-4eab-b7b4-2383c10cd629 _endpoint_config={} You should duplicate this configuration and place it within your .env file. Remember, the final property, _endpoint_config, necessitates a valid JSON containing your endpoint&rsquo;s configuration. Thus, you might need to customize this aspect.
If you&rsquo;ve employed the skeleton endpoint, your configuration might resemble the following:
_endpoint_name=proxy _app_name=yourtestapp _environment=dev _pod_id=id _profile=default _custom_domain= _debug=true _local_deployment=true _base_domain=slingrs.io _webservices_port=10000 _endpoints_services_api=https://yourtestapp.slingrs.io/dev/endpoints/proxy/api _token=91833a8b-929f-4eab-b7b4-2383c10cd629 _endpoint_config={&quot;token&quot;:&quot;123456&quot;} Please note that the .env file is only relevant when running the endpoint locally. It doesn&rsquo;t impact the endpoint&rsquo;s behavior when operating in the cloud, as the endpoint configuration is conveyed through a different mechanism.
Should the need arise, you can maintain multiple .env files for distinct environments or setups. For instance, you could incorporate supplementary files like .staging.env or .myCustomEnv.env. In such scenarios, you must run your endpoint with the NODE_ENV environment variable aligned with the respective file&rsquo;s name. For guidance on setting environment variables across various operating systems and terminals, refer to this resource. By default, the .env file is loaded.
Once you have established the proxy endpoint within your app, remember to commit and push changes to initiate the setup.
Executing your endpoint # Before you execute your endpoint, ensure that you have installed all the required dependencies:
cd ENDPOINT_FOLDER npm install Following this, you can proceed to run your endpoint either from the command line or through your integrated development environment (IDE):
node endpoint.js or
npm start Alternatively, you have the option to create a personalized start script within the package.json file.
Testing the functionality of your endpoint # With your endpoint operational and the proxy endpoint configured, it&rsquo;s prudent to conduct a swift test to ensure all components are functioning as intended. To execute this test, implement the provided code within your builder or monitor console:
var res = app.endpoints.proxy.randomNumber({}); log('res: '+JSON.stringify(res)); Upon execution, you should observe an output resembling the following:
res: {&quot;number&quot;:5560} Please note that we are making the assumption that you are utilizing the skeleton endpoint template, where this method is readily accessible. In case you are employing a different template, make sure to invoke a method that exists within your endpoint.

An entity defines the following aspects:`,content:`Entities are the fundamental concept in a Slingr app. They define both the data structure and the behavior of an app. Entities can represent various entities like companies, people, tasks, projects, and more.
Once an entity is created, you can create records within that entity. For instance, if you have an entity named companies, each individual company under that entity will be treated as a record.
An entity defines the following aspects:
Settings: These encompass details such as name, label, history logs, indexes, etc. Fields: Fields establish the structure of the entity, affecting both the database and the UI. Actions: Here, you can define the &ldquo;behavior&rdquo; or actions associated with the entity. Permissions: Specify who has access to operations, actions, and fields within the entity. Settings # Label # The label represents a human-readable name for the entity. It can include spaces, special characters, and a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters.
This label is used as a reference for the entity within the user interface. Changing the label of an entity does not require any data restructuring.
Name # The name is the internal identifier for the entity. It cannot contain special characters or spaces.
This name serves various purposes within the app:
Database: Records for the entity are stored under this name. REST API: The automatically generated REST API uses this name for URLs. Scripts: Scripts often reference the entity by its name. Changing the entity&rsquo;s name impacts all of the above aspects.
Database changes are handled automatically by the platform when changes are pushed, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
Changes in the REST API are also managed automatically. However, if external apps are using the REST API, those apps might require adjustments.
Scripts using the entity name need manual updates. We plan to provide assistance for these cases in the near future.
Type # The type setting defines the behavior of the entity:
Data: This signifies that the entity holds app data. It&rsquo;s the default and most common option. Data in this entity is excluded from backups and doesn&rsquo;t synchronize between environments and linked apps. Enum: These entities usually contain a small number of records that contribute to the app&rsquo;s metadata, such as order types or states. Records in this entity are included in backups and synchronized across environments and linked apps. Sync behavior options include: Not syncing: The entity acts like a data entity, with no record synchronization. Create new records: Only new records are synced; existing records in the target environment aren&rsquo;t deleted or updated. Create and update records: New and existing records are synced; changes to existing records in the target environment are overwritten. Full sync: Synchronization ensures records in the target environment match those in the source environment, potentially leading to record deletions. Calculated: This type calculates entity data. It&rsquo;s useful for representing external data in the app, and behaves the same as Data entities. System: Platform-created and managed entities that can be extended with custom configurations like fields and actions. Autogenerated metadata for these entities is immutable. They reside under the System folder. An example is the Users entity, created during app provisioning. Parent entity # Entities can inherit from other entities, reducing redundancy in the app.
Inheriting from a parent entity provides access to the parent entity&rsquo;s fields, actions, and indexes within the child entity.
Abstract # Setting an entity as abstract when inheriting means instances of this entity won&rsquo;t exist. Views can&rsquo;t be created for abstract entities.
Record label # Records possess a label used as a summary in various app contexts. For instance, in relationship fields, the label appears when selecting a record.
Typically, the label should represent the record&rsquo;s content. For example, if the entity contains individual information, the label could be the person&rsquo;s full name.
Two methods exist to define record labels:
Field: Select an entity field whose string value serves as the record&rsquo;s label. Script: For more flexibility, write a script returning the record&rsquo;s label. Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the label is being calculated. Returns # string - You should return the label of the record.
Samples # // builds the label using first and last names return record.field('firstName').val()+' '+record.field('lastName').val(); Modifying the record label definition triggers data refactorings across the entity&rsquo;s records. This also applies to records within entities that possess relationship fields pointing to records in the entity where the label was altered.
Indexes # Indexes play a crucial role in enhancing query performance and follow the principles of traditional databases. For instance, if your entity comprises a substantial number of records and you frequently query by the sku field, creating an index for the sku field can significantly expedite those queries and mitigate the need for full scans.
Indexes can be generated directly within the Indexes section of an entity. Alternatively, they are automatically generated when you designate a field as Unique or Indexable.
Each index encompasses the following properties:
Name: This signifies the index name in the database. It is automatically computed and unalterable. Type: The index type is automatically determined based on the chosen fields. Possible types encompass: Normal: Regular indexes. Relationship: Created for fields applied to relationships, users, groups, or files. Comprises ID and label indexes. Compound: Generated when multiple fields are selected. Status: Denotes the present index creation status. While you can create the index in the builder, it won&rsquo;t manifest in the database until changes are pushed or synced. During index creation, potential issues might arise, and the status helps ensure successful creation. Unique: This flag indicates whether index values must be unique. If duplicate values exist in existing records, index creation will fail. Fields: Lists the fields forming the index. Remember that in queries, all indexed fields must be queried to utilize the index effectively. Adding or removing indexes results in the construction or removal of indexes, which can be time-consuming for entities with numerous records. It&rsquo;s important to note that indexes entail overhead during record creation, update, and deletion, as they need to be updated. Hence, make sure to only generate indexes when they are genuinely essential.
Global search # Enabling the Allow Global Search flag initiates index creation, thereby enabling efficient word-based querying across all fields of the record. This feature significantly enhances the ability to search across the contents of various fields.
For more details on how Global Search operates, refer to this documentation.
Record validations # Record validations empower you to execute intricate validations encompassing all fields within a record. Moreover, they facilitate interaction with external services, capabilities that are beyond the scope of field-level rules.
For instance, you might possess an endpoint for address validation services that can be utilized to validate addresses. Alternatively, you might require certain fields to conform to specific patterns when specific options are selected.
This is the script context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record to validate. Returns # object[] - You should return an array of errors.
To handle errors effectively, return an array of error objects following this structure:
path: This corresponds to the field&rsquo;s location with issues. For nested fields like address.zipCode, provide the full path. For multi-valued fields, specify the index, such as addresses[1].zipCode.
code: Assign an appropriate error code. This code will be included in the response when attempting to create/update a record via the REST API or as exception information when saving a record with the JavaScript API.
message: Craft a descriptive error message that will not only be displayed in the user interface but also sent in response, along with the associated error code.
[ { path: 'addressLine', code: 'invalid', message: 'This is not a valid US address' },{ path: 'zipCode', code: 'invalid', message: 'This is not a valid US zip code' } ] Samples # // validates the zip code using an external service var errors = []; var zipCode = record.field('address.zipCode').val(); if (!app.endpoints.addressValidator.isValidZipCode(zipCode)) { errors.push({ path: 'address.zipCode', code: 'invalid', message: 'This is not a valid US zip code' }); } return errors; Lookup fields # Fields configured with this feature are considered during record retrieval. To look up a specific record, these fields are used in conjunction with the default system fields: ID and label.
Lookup fields require the unique flag to be enabled.
Detailed logs # This feature enables more detailed logging for various record operations: create, edit, delete, and the execution of actions on data records.
Activate this feature at the entity level through this setting:
Enable Detailed Logging: Toggle to enable detailed logging for record operations. History logs # This feature allows you to log changes in records, which is useful for auditing purposes. You can track when a record was created, the different changes made to it over time, as well as the modified fields and people involved in those changes.
When history logs are enabled for an entity, you can query logs for a specific record (or even all records at the same time) using the REST API or the UI. See History for more details.
Several settings control what gets logged in the history of records:
Logs Expiration: Define rules to determine when logs should expire. Delete Policy: Indicate what to do with the history of a record when it is deleted. Delete History with Record: Delete the history logs when the record is deleted. Keep History: Keep the history logs of the record. When this option is selected, specify how long the history logs will be kept (e.g., number of days, weeks, or months). User Events: Track changes made as a consequence of an external request, such as from the REST API or the UI. These events include: Ignore Fields: Exclude specific fields from change tracking when changes are made through the REST API or the UI. This can be useful for fields that are updated frequently or contain extensive content. Record Created: Log the creation of records via the REST API or the UI. Record Changed: Log updates to records via the REST API or the UI. Record Deleted: Log record deletions via the REST API or the UI. Action Executed: Log the execution of actions on individual records via the REST API or the UI. Events from Scripts: These are events generated from scripts in the app, such as when a script uses the method &lsquo;sys.data.save()&rsquo;. Ignore Fields: Exclude specific fields from change tracking when changes are made from a script in the app. This can be useful for fields that are updated frequently or contain extensive content. Record Created: Log the creation of records from a script in the app. Record Changed: Log updates to records from a script in the app. Record Deleted: Log record deletions from a script in the app. Action Executed: Log the execution of actions on individual records from a script in the app. System Events: These events result as side effects of other operations. For example, updating the label of a record that is referenced by another record will update the relationship. Generally, you don&rsquo;t want to track these kinds of changes. Cascade Updates: These events are generated when a change in one record needs to be propagated to other records. For instance, when copied fields in a relationship field are updated in a record, they need to be copied to relationship fields referencing that record. Refactorings: If this flag is set, when changes are made in the entity definition that lead to refactorings on records (e.g., field deletion or label changes), a log for it will be created. Data generation settings # These settings are only available for Calculated Entities.
Schedule time expression # This expression determines when the script for generating data should run. The minimum supported frequency is 15 minutes. Refer to this documentation for more information on the format of the expression.
Condition type # Choose whether data should always be generated when the time expression is met or if you want to evaluate it using a script.
Condition # This script determines if data should be regenerated and is only available if you choose Script as the condition type. The script should return true if regeneration is necessary or false otherwise. The Data Generation Script will only run if this script returns true.
Data generation script # This script should return a list of either Record objects or JSON objects that can be mapped to a Record object.
Behavior during regeneration # This flag allows to configure the behavior when data it’s being generated. It applies to data queries.
If the flag it’s set to true, when trying to read any data for this entity, if data it’s being generated at that moment, that read operation will wait until data generation ends. If the flag it’s set to false, when trying to read any data for this entity, if data it’s being generated at that moment, an AccessForbiddenException will be thrown. Fields # Fields define what information will be stored in records of the entity.
Slingr allows to have more complex structures than you usually can use in traditional relational database. For example it is allowed to have multi-valued fields as well as nested fields. These features make it is easy to define a more natural model.
For example you might have an entity with this structure:
name type phoneNumbers (multi-valued) addresses (multi-valued) addressLine zipCode state Each field has a type, which defines which data can be stored there as well as rules and display options. You can check the copied field types here.
Apart from the type-specific settings, all fields share some common features. For more details check Fields.
There are two special field types that are worth mentioning:
Nested fields: this type can hold other fields inside of it. This allows to have multiple levels of nesting. You can find more information here. Relationship: this type allows to reference another record of any entity. This way it is possible to create relationships between data. You can find more information here. Changes on fields and data refactorings # If you make changes to the structure of the entity by removing fields or making changes to existing fields in a way that affect the data structure (for example you change the field name), when those changes are pushed or synced, data refactorings will be done to adjust all records to the new structure.
For example if you rename a field from type to category, when changes are pushed or synced a refactoring over all records will be done to rename field type to category.
A more complex case happens when you change the type of the field. Let&rsquo;s suppose that the field itemCode was an integer field but it is changed to a text field. In this case the data refactoring will convert numbers to strings and the value will be preserved.
However, if you are converting in the other way around, the conversion might not be valid in some cases. For example if the value was the string &quot;10&quot;, then it can be safely converted to the number 10, but if the value was A10 then it is not a valid integer number and the field value will be set to null.
The rule during conversions is that the original value will be converted to its string representation, and the new type will try to parse that string representation. If the parsing fails, the value will be set to null.
Finally, another conversion that can affect the structure is multiplicity changes. If a field is changed from single-valued to multi-valued, existing value will be set as the first value in the field. On the other hand, if the multiplicity is changed from multi-valued to single-valued, only the first value will be kept, discarding any additional value of the field.
Changes in rules # If there are changes in the rules of a field, it is possible that records that were valid before are not longer valid. For example you have a text field and you add a maximum length of 10 characters. If there were already records with values longer than 10 characters for that field, those records won&rsquo;t be valid any longer.
When this happens records will be kept as they are. If you try to update them the validation error will show up and you will need to fix it before proceeding.
Actions # Actions allow to define some behavior on records. For example, in an entity that holds tasks, you could have an action to complete it, that will check that all pre-conditions are met, update the status and notify people involved in the task.
There are basically two types of actions:
One record: these actions are applied to one record at a time. Even when it is possible to select many records through the UI or send many IDs on the REST API, this action will be applied at one record at a time. The action doesn&rsquo;t know how many records are involved, it is only aware of the record the action is being applied. Many records: these actions take a query as parameter that defines the selection of records. This way the action knows all the records involved and it can do something with all of them at the same time. For example you could have an action to send a summary of many tasks in one email, which is not possible to do with actions that are executed over individual records. For more information about actions, please check the documentation for Actions.
Record listeners # Record Listeners can be hooked to different record events, like record created, changed, action executed, etc.
Those listeners will be listed in the entity, however they can also be managed from the Model &gt; Listeners section in the app builder.
For Caculated entities they have a different behavior. These listeners are used to update the records and they will be only listed in the calculated entity.
For more information check the documentation of Listeners.
External listeners # These listeners are only available for Caculated entities. External Listeners can be hooked to different record events, like record created, changed, action executed, etc.
Those listeners will be listed in the entity, however they can also be managed fromthe Model &gt; Listeners section in the app builder.
For more information check the documentation of Listeners.
Permissions # Permissions allow to define which operations can be done for each group on records of the entity.
Permissions for an entity can be handled right in the entity definition, but it is just a different view of what you can configure in groups. It is oriented so you can easily configure permissions on the entity for all existing groups.
When a new entity is added, no permissions are added to any group by default.
For more information about permissions please refer to Groups.

A pivotal attribute of a field is its type, which determines the available options, rules, display preferences, and user interfaces for editing and reading. More information about types is available here.
Field settings are organized as follows:
Basic Settings: These foundational settings are essential for all fields. They encompass the name, label, type, and multiplicity. All of these settings are mandatory. Rules: These settings influence value validation and storage in the database. For instance, designating a field as sensitive will result in encrypted database storage and exclusion from logs. There might also be type-specific rules, such as defining minimum and maximum values for an integer field. General Rules: These settings are universal across all types, though certain types may lack some options. Type-Specific Rules: These settings are tailored to each type. For instance, text fields offer rules for specifying the minimum and maximum string length. Display Options: Unlike rules, display options don&rsquo;t impact value validation or database storage. They focus solely on the field&rsquo;s appearance in the user interface. General Display Options: These overall settings influence how the field is visually presented, without affecting its value. For example, you can define label aesthetics and value indentation, but these settings won&rsquo;t dictate how field values are displayed. Type-Specific Display Options: These settings determine how the field&rsquo;s value is shown. For instance, in the case of a relationship field, you can choose to display the reference as a link. During editing, you might opt for a dropdown or selection boxes to choose a new value. For insights into type-specific settings, please refer to the Types documentation.
Basic settings # Label # This represents the human-readable field name. It&rsquo;s what appears in the UI when the field is displayed.
Display options can override this label, useful for showing distinct labels in specific contexts.
Name # This is the internal field name, used in the REST and JavaScript APIs, as well as for database storage within entities.
The name must not contain special characters or spaces; only letters and numbers are allowed.
Keep in mind that altering the field name can have ramifications:
Database: Renaming a field within an entity triggers data refactoring during pushes or syncs. For entities with substantial records, this renaming process might take some time. REST API: External apps utilizing this field through the REST API will require updates, as the field name changes. Scripts: If any app scripts reference this field in queries or for fetching values, manual updates to these scripts are necessary. Future tools are anticipated to aid in such cases. Type # The field&rsquo;s type determines the allowable content and its visual rendering. Each type is associated with specific rules and display options.
To explore available types and their features, please refer to the Types documentation.
When altering the field type, during pushes or syncs, the app will attempt to automatically convert existing values to the new type. The conversion rule is as follows: the original value will be transformed into its string representation, which will then be parsed by the new type. If parsing fails, the value will be set to null.
Note that changing a field&rsquo;s type may result in side effects:
Database: If the field was used within an entity, modifying its type might trigger data refactoring to adapt the value to the new type. REST API: External apps utilizing this field via the REST API may need updates due to potential changes in the field&rsquo;s format. For instance, if the field type shifts from integer to text, the REST API will return a string instead of a number. Scripts: If there were scripts in the app referencing this field, updates might be necessary, especially if the scripts relied on type-specific features. Multiplicity # Multiplicity indicates whether the field can store one or multiple values. For instance, you could have an emails field capable of holding multiple email addresses for users with more than one email.
Changing the multiplicity of an existing field triggers automatic refactoring of existing records. If a field transitions from single-valued to multi-valued, the existing value becomes the first value in the field. Conversely, when shifting from multi-valued to single-valued, only the first value remains, discarding any additional values.
Note that changing field multiplicity might entail side effects:
Database: If the field was used within an entity, alterations to multiplicity may trigger data refactoring during pushes or syncs to adjust the structure. REST API: External apps relying on the field through the REST API will require updates, as the field structure will change. Scripts: Scripts referencing this field in the app may need updating if they make assumptions about the field&rsquo;s multiplicity. General rules # Default value # You can set a default value for a field. The behavior varies based on the context:
Entity Field: The default value applies solely when creating a new record; it won&rsquo;t affect editing existing records. Action's Parameter: The default value takes effect only if the parameter is empty. Usually, changing this setting doesn&rsquo;t trigger any refactoring and mainly affects new records. However, if the field is also marked as required or if it&rsquo;s a newly added field, a refactoring might occur to assign the default value to all records where this field is empty or added.
Default values can be defined in two ways:
Value: You can choose a fixed value as the default.
Script: Alternatively, you can provide a script to calculate the default value. Here&rsquo;s the script context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This record is linked to the operation at hand. If the default value is for an entity field, this record encompasses the field. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that, in this context, the default value is generally computed before record creation. As a result, many fields might be empty in this phase. The only scenario in which other fields are populated is when introducing a new field or when the required flag has been added. Thus, during default value calculation, other fields might already be present.
If the field serves as an action parameter, this record pertains to the ongoing execution of the action. In such cases, the record contains values and is notably more informative. parentField sys.data.Record This variable exclusively comes into play when dealing with a field nested within another field. Its behavior aligns with the rules applicable to variables associated with records or actions (similar principles apply whether it&rsquo;s an action parameter or an entity field).
The variable takes the form of a sys.data.Record object, albeit with a distinction: the record&rsquo;s root is set to the encompassing nested fields. This arrangement facilitates access to fields within the nested group. For instance, you can utilize parentField.field('fieldA') instead of resorting to record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'). This feature proves especially invaluable when nested fields are multi-valued, as you are not required to know the index. action sys.data.Action This variable becomes accessible exclusively when the field serves as an action parameter. It grants access to other parameters, though it&rsquo;s important to note that these parameters might be devoid of content, unless an initial value has been designated. Returns # any or any[] - You should return the calculated value in the format used in the Javascript API for the type of the field. If the field is multi-valued, you should return an array.
Samples # // if current user has an email with 'slingr.io', set this field to 'true' let flag = false; const currentUser = sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord(); if (currentUser.field('email').val().indexOf('@slingr.io') != -1) { flag = true; } return flag; Required # Enabling this flag designates a field as required. A required field necessitates a value. This value can be explicitly set or drawn from the default value. If no value is furnished for the field and no default value exists, an attempt to save the record will trigger a validation error.
The available choices for the required flag are as follows:
Always: The field is consistently obligatory.
Script: The field&rsquo;s requirement hinges on the script&rsquo;s evaluation yielding true. Here&rsquo;s the script&rsquo;s context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This record is linked to the ongoing operation. If the field resides within an entity field, this record corresponds to the container of that field.
In the case of a field serving as an action parameter, this record pertains to the execution of the action. parentField sys.data.Record This variable is exclusively accessible when the field is situated within a nested field. It operates based on the variable record or action, adhering to the same principles applicable to action parameters or entity fields.
The variable assumes the form of a sys.data.Record object. The key distinction is that the record&rsquo;s root is set to encompass the nested fields in which it resides. This configuration facilitates the retrieval of fields within the nested group. For instance, you can employ parentField.field('fieldA') as an alternative to record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'). This feature proves particularly valuable in cases involving multi-valued nested fields where index awareness might be absent. action sys.data.Action This variable is accessible solely when the field functions as an action parameter. It facilitates access to other parameters. Returns # boolean - You should return true if the field must be required, false otherwise.
Samples # // if 'numberOfExmployees' is bigger than 10, then this field is required return record.field('numberOfEmployees').val() &gt; 10; Expression: The field becomes required if the expression evaluates to true. For further details, consult the Expressions documentation.
Never: The field remains non-required. This is the default setting.
Unique # This flag indicates whether the value must be unique across all records in the entity. When activated, the app enforces this validation.
Empty values will not be considered when assessing uniqueness. Consequently, numerous records may possess an empty field.
Activating this flag generates an index with respect to this field.
It&rsquo;s important to note that the flag can be enabled even if duplicated values exist in current records. Handling such cases of duplication will require manual intervention.
Indexable # Upon enabling this flag, an index will be established for the field. This can prove beneficial for enhancing performance in scenarios where querying using this field is frequent and the entity contains a substantial number of records.
Bear in mind that index creation introduces some overhead during record creation, updates, and deletions, as well as impacts storage requirements. Consequently, you should only set the indexable flag when it&rsquo;s genuinely necessary.
Unless you possess advance knowledge of which entities will amass numerous records and understand the anticipated data querying patterns, we recommend initially forgoing indexes and only introducing them as performance concerns emerge.
Transient # When this flag is activated, values won&rsquo;t be permanently stored in the database. However, you can still manipulate the values within these fields during record processing. For instance, if you have a listener that triggers when records are created, you can utilize the value of this field in the listener&rsquo;s script to perform specific actions.
Sensitive # Activating this flag triggers enhanced precautions when handling data within these fields:
For user-sent data that&rsquo;s logged, fields marked as sensitive will be masked. These fields will be encrypted in the database. When data is synchronized from production to another environment, the data in these fields will be obfuscated. This flag can be used in conjunction with the transient flag. For instance, it&rsquo;s illogical to avoid storing credit card information in the database if it&rsquo;s being logged in plain text. In such cases, when both flags are set, the data will be masked in logs and won&rsquo;t be stored or synced.
However, designating a field as sensitive carries certain limitations:
Filtering only functions for text fields, and searches must match the exact text (no partial matching). Sorting won&rsquo;t function for these fields. Read/Write access # This attribute indicates when the field can be read from and written to. Consider the following scenario with fields:
type (a choice field with options a, b, and c) subType (visible only if type is c) In this instance, you might want the subType field to only appear when type is set to c. This can be achieved using a read/write access condition on the subType field.
If you require distinct access rules for reading and writing, you can uncheck the Sync read/write flag. This allows you to define separate conditions for read and write access. Although uncommon, such a configuration might be necessary.
The available read/write access options include:
Always: The field is perpetually accessible.
Script: When the script returns true, the field becomes accessible; otherwise, it remains inaccessible. Here&rsquo;s the script&rsquo;s context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This record is linked to the ongoing operation. If the field resides within an entity field, this record corresponds to the container of that field.
In the case of a field serving as an action parameter, this record pertains to the execution of the action. parentField sys.data.Record This variable is exclusively accessible when the field is situated within a nested field. It operates based on the variable record or action, adhering to the same principles applicable to action parameters or entity fields.
The variable assumes the form of a sys.data.Record object. The key distinction is that the record&rsquo;s root is set to encompass the nested fields in which it resides. This configuration facilitates the retrieval of fields within the nested group. For instance, you can employ parentField.field('fieldA') as an alternative to record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'). This feature proves particularly valuable in cases involving multi-valued nested fields where index awareness might be absent. action sys.data.Action This variable is accessible solely when the field functions as an action parameter. It facilitates access to other parameters. Returns # boolean - You should return true if there is access to the field, false otherwise.
Samples # // if 'numberOfExmployees' is bigger than 10, then this field is visible return record.field('numberOfEmployees').val() &gt; 10; Expression: The field becomes accessible if the expression evaluates to true. More information is available in the Expressions documentation.
Never: The field will never be accessible. This option is relevant only when the Sync read/write flag is unchecked and you&rsquo;ve selected either the read or write option.
It&rsquo;s worth highlighting that access control here differs from permission settings. In this context, rules apply universally to all users, and there&rsquo;s no way to bypass these rules, even via scripting. In contrast, permissions don&rsquo;t affect developers and system users and are similarly disregarded in scripts.
Calculated value # Certain types permit the field to be calculated, implying that the field&rsquo;s value will be derived from other data, and users won&rsquo;t be able to manually set it.
Two approaches exist for calculating a value:
Script: In this scenario, you can furnish a script to compute the value. Here&rsquo;s the script&rsquo;s context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This record is linked to the ongoing operation. If the field resides within an entity field, this record corresponds to the container of that field.
In the case of a field serving as an action parameter, this record pertains to the execution of the action. parentField sys.data.Record This variable is exclusively accessible when the field is situated within a nested field. It operates based on the variable record or action, adhering to the same principles applicable to action parameters or entity fields.
The variable assumes the form of a sys.data.Record object. The key distinction is that the record&rsquo;s root is set to encompass the nested fields in which it resides. This configuration facilitates the retrieval of fields within the nested group. For instance, you can employ parentField.field('fieldA') as an alternative to record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'). This feature proves particularly valuable in cases involving multi-valued nested fields where index awareness might be absent. action sys.data.Action This variable is accessible solely when the field functions as an action parameter. It facilitates access to other parameters. Returns # any or any[] - You should return the calculated value in the format used in the Javascript API for the type of the field. If the field is multi-valued, you should return an array.
Samples # // calculate the total price from the unit price and quantity return record.field('unitPrice').val() * record.field('quantity').val(); Note: The accurate sequence of field calculations is automatically managed within the bounds of the current entity&rsquo;s scope. This signifies that if you invoke a script outside of the entity scope, any associated dependencies will not be monitored. For instance, when utilizing a library to compute values, ensure you make the call in the following manner:
var field1 = record.field('fiedl1').val(); var field2 = record.field('field2').val(); app.utils.foo(field1, field2); instead of: app.utils.foo(record); Aggregate: In this scenario, you can compute a value based on an aggregate query involving other records. For instance, if you possess an entity named departments and another named employees with a field labeled salary, you could create a field for calculating the average salary per department. This calculation would be an aggregation over the employees entity, considering records with the department field pointing to the department being evaluated. The aggregation would involve calculating an average over the salary field. This aggregation would be dynamically updated each time a salary changes or an employee is added or removed from a department. Thus, when you select the Aggregate calculation, you have access to the following options:
Aggregate Entity: The entity housing the records to be aggregated. In the aforementioned example, this would be the employees entity. Expression: This expression filters which records from the Aggregate Entity are included in the aggregation. In the earlier example, the expression filtered records by matching the Current Record with the department field, thus ensuring only employees from the current department contribute to the aggregation. Aggregate Operation: This operation dictates what action to perform. Options include: Count: This simply tallies the number of records matching the expression. Sum: It calculates the sum of values in the Aggregate Field (see below) for records fulfilling the expression. Avg: It computes the average of values in the Aggregate Field (see below) for records satisfying the expression. Aggregate Field: If the Aggregate Operation isn&rsquo;t Count, a field must be chosen to which the operation applies. In the example above, the selected field is salary. Custom validations # Custom validations enable the execution of intricate validations on the field, along with the use of services not available within field rules. In cases where the field is multi-valued, this validation will be triggered for each individual value. If you need to validate multiple values simultaneously, record validations should be employed.
For instance, consider a legacy service that utilizes an address validation service or the need to ensure a field value adheres to a specific pattern.
Here&rsquo;s the script&rsquo;s context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record that contains the field to validate. parentField sys.data.Record This variable is exclusively accessible when the field is situated within a nested field. It operates based on the variable record or action, adhering to the same principles applicable to action parameters or entity fields.
The variable assumes the form of a sys.data.Record object. The key distinction is that the record&rsquo;s root is set to encompass the nested fields in which it resides. This configuration facilitates the retrieval of fields within the nested group. For instance, you can employ parentField.field('fieldA') as an alternative to record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'). This feature proves particularly valuable in cases involving multi-valued nested fields where index awareness might be absent. field sys.data.Wrapper The field wrapper to be validated. For more details on how to manipulate it, refer to the documentation for sys.data.Wrapper. action sys.data.Action This variable will be available only if the field is an action parameter. It will provide access to other parameters, but keep in mind that they might be empty (except that they have an initial value set). Returns # object - You should return an object representing the error, something like this:
{code: 'invalid', message: 'This is not a valid US zip code'} Where code represents the error code. You can use any value that aligns with your context. This value will be included in the response when attempting to create/update a record through the REST API or as part of the exception information when saving a record using the JavaScript API.
The message parameter corresponds to the text that will be showcased in the user interface. It will also be included in the response along with the code.
When the field is considered valid, no response is required.
Samples # // validates the zip code using an expression var zipValue = field.val(); if (zipValue &amp;&amp; !/(^\\d{5}$)|(^\\d{5}-\\d{4}$)/.test(zipValue)) { return {code: 'invalid', message: 'This is not a valid US zip code'}; } // validates the zip code using an external service var zipValue = field.val(); if (!app.endpoints.addressValidator.isValidZipCode(zipValue)) { return {code: 'invalid', message: 'This is not a valid US zip code'}; } Type rules # In this section, you configure rules that are specific to the field&rsquo;s data type. For instance, a text field will have rules that limit the length of the value, while choice fields will define valid options.
There are three methods to define type rules:
Custom: You manually define type rules for this field. To learn which rules are available for each data type, consult the Types documentation. Predefined: You can select one of the global type rules configured in the &ldquo;App &gt; Types&rdquo; section of the app builder. Refer to Global Type Settings. Field: You can reference an existing field within the entity and inherit its type rules. Consequently, if the type rules for the referenced field are altered, the rules for this field will be automatically updated. General display options # Read-Only # This indicates when the field should be perpetually displayed in read-only mode.
Remember that this setting solely influences the UI. Consequently, although the field appears read-only, it can still be modified using the REST API or in another view where this flag isn&rsquo;t enabled.
For instance, consider the following fields:
type (a choice field with options a, b, and c) subType (only editable if type is c) In this scenario, you desire the subType field to be editable exclusively when type is set to c. Achieving this involves employing a read-only condition on the subType field.
Read-Only has the following options:
Always: The field is consistently read-only.
Script: If the script returns true, the field becomes editable; otherwise, it remains read-only. Here&rsquo;s the script&rsquo;s context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This record is linked to the ongoing operation. If the field resides within an entity field, this record corresponds to the container of that field.
In the case of a field serving as an action parameter, this record pertains to the execution of the action. parentField sys.data.Record This variable is exclusively accessible when the field is situated within a nested field. It operates based on the variable record or action, adhering to the same principles applicable to action parameters or entity fields.

For instance, you can employ parentField.field('fieldA') as an alternative to record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'). This feature proves particularly valuable in cases involving multi-valued nested fields where index awareness might be absent. action sys.data.Action This variable is accessible solely when the field functions as an action parameter. It facilitates access to other parameters. Returns # boolean - You should return true if there is access to the field, false otherwise.
Samples # // if 'numberOfExmployees' is bigger than 10, then this field is visible return record.field('numberOfEmployees').val() &gt; 10; Expression: The field becomes editable if the expression evaluates to true. Additional information is available in the Expressions documentation.
Never: The field will remain uneditable. This is the default option.
Visible # If set to Never, the field won&rsquo;t be displayed even when included in the view. This flag proves valuable, eliminating the need to manually remove the field from managed views.
Remember that this setting solely influences the UI.
For example, consider the following fields:
type (a choice field with options a, b, and c) subType (only visible if type is c) In this instance, you want the subType field to exclusively appear when type is set to c. This can be accomplished through a visibility condition applied to the subType field.
Visibility has the following options:
Always: The field is consistently visible. This is the default option.
Script: If the script returns true, the field becomes visible; otherwise, it remains hidden. Here&rsquo;s the script&rsquo;s context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This record is linked to the ongoing operation. If the field resides within an entity field, this record corresponds to the container of that field.

Samples # // if 'numberOfExmployees' is bigger than 10, then this field is visible return record.field('numberOfEmployees').val() &gt; 10; Expression: The field becomes visible if the expression evaluates to true. More details can be found in the Expressions documentation.
Never: The field will never be visible.
Sorting # Indicates the sorting order for values:
Oldest to Newest: Oldest values appear at the top, and new values are inserted at the bottom of the list. This is the default. Newest to Oldest: Newest values appear at the top, and new values are inserted at the top as well. This option is only visible in fields with a multiplicity of Many.
Pagination # Enabling this flag results in paginated values. This prevents excessive space usage on the form if the field contains numerous values, allowing users to fetch additional values as needed. The default page size is 5.
This option is only visible in fields with a multiplicity of Many.
Page Size # When Pagination is enabled, this setting lets you define the number of values to display on each page. The default is 5.
Customize add button # Enabling this flag introduces additional options to customize the appearance of the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button, used to add more values to the field.
This option is only visible in fields with a multiplicity of Many.
Text to append # When Customize Add Button is enabled, this setting determines the text appended to the button&rsquo;s label. For instance, setting this field to Note results in a button label of Add Note instead of just Add.
Label options # Show label # Indicates whether the label should be displayed. If the label is hidden, you can choose whether to indent the value using the Indent Value flag.
Override label # Enabling this flag permits overriding the default label. This can be useful in specific views where a distinct label is desired.
Indent value # If Show Label is not enabled, you can determine whether to indent the value. This flag controls this behavior.
Value options # Text alignment # Specifies text alignment for the read-only view. Possible values are Left, Center, or Right. Applicable to all data types except Nested Fields, File, Html, and Color.
Help message # An informational message displayed when hovering over the information icon next to the field&rsquo;s label. Developers can utilize this to explain the field&rsquo;s purpose. Only visible during editing.
Placeholder # Provides a brief hint describing the expected value of an input field.
Prepend addon type # Allows inclusion of an addon (Text or Icon) on the left side of the input field. Available for text and numeric data types. Disabled by default.
Prepend addon text # For Text addon type, specifies the text to add to the left side of the input field.
Prepend addon icon # For Icon addon type, specifies the icon to add to the left side of the input field.
Append addon type # Allows inclusion of an addon (Text or Icon) on the right side of the input field. Available for text and numeric data types. Disabled by default.
Append addon text # For Text addon type, specifies the text to add to the right side of the input field.
Append addon icon # For Icon addon type, specifies the icon to add to the right side of the input field.
Type display pptions # In this section, you configure display options specific to the data type. Three methods are available:
Custom: Manually define display options for this field. Refer to the Types documentation for available options for each type. Predefined: Select a global display option configured in the &ldquo;App &gt; Types&rdquo; section of the app builder. See Global Type Settings. Field: Reference an existing field in the entity to inherit its display options. Changes to display options in the referenced field will automatically update this field. Permissions # Permissions determine which groups have access to the field. Permissions are enforced in both the UI and the REST API.
Here, access permissions for the field can be specified. Options include:
Parent: Inherits permissions from the parent field. This is only available for fields within nested fields and is the default behavior. Read/Write: Users in this group can read and write to this field. Read Only: Users in this group can only read this field. If they attempt to modify the value during an update, the change will be silently discarded. None: Users in this group cannot read or write to this field. The field will be entirely omitted from both the UI and REST API. Advanced: Enables configuring read or write access separately, optionally based on record data using expression filters or scripts. This mirrors the capability of Read/Write Access in fields. When a new field is added to an entity, permissions are automatically set based on the group&rsquo;s access to the entity (Can Create or Can Edit set to Always or Condition). If there&rsquo;s only read access to the entity (Can Access set to Always or Condition), read-only access is granted to the field for that group. No permissions are automatically set otherwise.
For more information about permissions, refer to the Groups documentation.

For example, in an entity that manages tasks, you could implement an action to mark a task as complete. This action might involve checking preconditions, updating the task&rsquo;s status, and notifying relevant parties.
Once an action is defined for an entity, it becomes accessible through the UI, the REST API, and the JavaScript API.
Action settings # Label # This is the human-readable name of the action, which will be displayed in the UI.
Name # The name serves as the internal identifier for the action and is used in both the REST and JavaScript APIs.
The name must consist only of letters and numbers, without special characters or spaces. It&rsquo;s important to note that changing the action&rsquo;s name might have consequences:
REST API: External applications using this action through the REST API will need updates, as the action&rsquo;s URL will change. Scripts: Any scripts in the app referencing this action will require manual updates. Future tools are planned to aid in such cases. Type # The action&rsquo;s type indicates whether it is executed for each individual record or as a batch operation for a group of records:
One Record: These actions are applied to one record at a time, even if you can select multiple records through the UI or provide multiple IDs in the REST API. The action processes each record individually, unaware of the total number of records involved. Many Records: These actions accept a query parameter that defines the record selection. This allows the action to operate on all selected records simultaneously. For example, you could create an action to send a summary of multiple tasks in a single email—a task not feasible with actions targeted at individual records. Actions for many records lack options like restricting to a single record and setting preconditions. Global Entity: These actions do not receive any parameter to determine affected records. They appear in all grid views and workflow views under a special section called Global Actions. An example might be an action named &ldquo;Check Payment Status&rdquo; in the Payments entity. When executed, it would script to check the status of all pending payments. Visible # This option controls the visibility of the action. If set to Never, even if the action is present in the view, it will remain hidden. This feature spares you the need to manually remove the action from each view.
Keep in mind that this is solely a UI setting.
The Visible options are:
Always: The action is always visible (default option).
Expression: The action becomes visible if the specified expression evaluates to true. Refer to the documentation for Expressions for more information.
Script: The action&rsquo;s visibility depends on the return value of a script. If the script returns true, the action is visible; otherwise, it&rsquo;s hidden. Here&rsquo;s the script context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the action will be executed.
This variable is only available if the type of the action is One record. Returns # boolean - true if conditions are met, false otherwise.
Samples # // make the action visible if the type is 'a' return record.field('type').val() == 'a'; Never: the action will be hidden.
Preconditions # For actions of type One record, you can define preconditions that determine the records on which the action can be applied. For instance, consider an entity named tasks with an action named complete. You might only want to allow this action when the status field is set to inProgress.
Preconditions can be established in two ways:
Expression: The action is executable on the record if the provided expression evaluates to true. Otherwise, the action won&rsquo;t be accessible in the UI, or it will result in an error when attempted through the REST or JavaScript API. For further details, consult the documentation on Expressions.
Script: The action is executable on the record if the script returns true. If not, the action won&rsquo;t appear in the UI or will result in an error when invoked via the REST or JavaScript API.
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the action will be executed. Returns # boolean - true if preconditions are met, false otherwise.
Samples # // preconditions of the action are met if type is 'a' and current user is in group 'test' return record.field('type').val() == 'a' &amp;&amp; sys.context.getCurrentUser().containsGroup('test'); Result as response # For actions of type One record or Global entity, you can specify whether the action should return a custom response. If enabled, the result returned by the action script will be used as the response.
For actions of type Many records, the return value of the action script is always utilized as the response for the action.
Any value returned by the script and intended as a response is transformed into valid JSON (if needed). The Content-Type of the response is consistently set to application/json. If JSON conversion is not feasible, an error will be triggered.
This setting solely affects the behavior of the REST API and is irrelevant to the UI. The returned value will be included in the response body of the request.
Save linked parameters # For actions of type One record, it&rsquo;s possible to include linked parameters. Enabling this flag ensures that the record is automatically updated with the values from linked parameters. If this flag is not set, you will be responsible for saving the record within the action script to make the changes permanent.
It&rsquo;s important to note that if this option is set, a record changed event will be triggered before executing the action script (when the record is saved). If you save the record again within the action script, another record changed event will be triggered, in addition to the event triggered by the action itself.
Execute in background # If this flag is enabled, executing the action will immediately return with a reference to a job responsible for performing the action in the background.
For instance, when using the REST API to execute the action, instead of receiving the action&rsquo;s result, you will receive a job reference that indicates the action will be carried out in the background. To determine completion, you should monitor the status of the job.
This flag can be overridden for a specific call through the REST API or JavaScript API. Additionally, the UI might choose to override this flag. For instance, when multiple records are selected, the UI will always send the action to the background, even if this flag is not set.
When this flag is not enabled, calls to the action will wait for its completion and return the action&rsquo;s result.
For more information on actions in the REST API and JavaScript API, refer to the documentation.
Avoid triggering UI events # Enabling this flag for executing the action in the background will prevent UI notifications from being triggered. This is valuable for efficiency during execution, particularly in batch processing scenarios where notifying end-users about data changes is unnecessary.
Restrict to only one record # For actions of type One record, enabling this flag signifies that only a single record can be selected and the action can be executed. This is particularly applicable when there are parameters that are not meaningful to apply to multiple records simultaneously.
For instance, if the action&rsquo;s purpose is to update the title of a task, executing it on more than one record is illogical since the same title would be set for numerous tasks.
Action script # The action&rsquo;s core script is executed when the action is invoked. It runs when the action is executed in the UI (when the action&rsquo;s execution is confirmed), and it is the place where the action&rsquo;s intended operations should be carried out.
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the action will be executed. This variable is only available if the type of the action is One record. oldRecord sys.data.Record The record before linked parameters are merged. This variable is only available if the type of the action is One record. query sys.data.Query A query object with filters to find all records afected by this action. This variable is only available if the type of the action is Many Records. action sys.data.Action This allows access to the parameters of the action. Samples # // updates some values in the record and save it var newValue = action.field('param1') * 10; record.field('field').val(newValue); sys.data.save(newValue); // many records actions that sums up the number of employees on selected companies var total = 0; var records = sys.data.find(query); while (records.hasNext()) { total += records.next().field('numberOfEmployees').val(); } return total; Custom validations # Custom validations for actions enable more intricate validations that span across all fields within the action. These validations can utilize external services or functionalities that aren&rsquo;t accessible through field rules.
For ONE_RECORD action types, the record is accessible within the script context. In the case of MANY_RECORDS, a Query object can be used to ascertain which records will be impacted.
For instance, consider an external endpoint for address validation that you can integrate to validate addresses. Alternatively, you might want to enforce a requirement that when a specific option is chosen in one field of the record or the action, another field&rsquo;s value must adhere to a specific pattern.
Here is the script context for these custom validations:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the action is executed. You can use this information on your validation rules. This parameter is only available when action type is ONE_RECORD query sys.data.Query A query object with filters to find all records afected by this action. This parameter is only available when action type is MANY_RECORDS action sys.data.Action The action to validate. Returns # object - You should return an array of errors, something like this:
[ { path: 'addressLine', code: 'invalid', message: 'Not a valid address when running this action' }, { path: 'zipCode', code: 'invalid', message: 'Wrong zip code' } ] Where path is the path to the field experiencing issues. For nested fields, the full path should be provided, such as address.zipCode. For multi-valued fields, the index should be indicated, like addresses[1].zipCode.
The code is an error code that you can define according to your needs. This code will be included in the response when attempting to execute the action using the REST API or the JavaScript API.
Finally, the message is what will be displayed in the UI and will also be included in the response along with the code.
Samples # // validates the zip code using an external service var errors = []; var zipCode = action.field('address.zipCode').val(); if (!app.endpoints.addressValidator.isValidZipCode(zipCode)) { errors.push({ path: 'address.zipCode', code: 'invalid', message: 'Wrong zip code' }); } return errors; Parameters # Parameters are fields that will be prompted for when the action is executed. For instance, when executing the action from the UI, a popup will appear asking the user to input values for the parameters configured in the action (refer to action views for more details on configuring the UI of an action).
Parameters can fall into three types:
Parameter: These fields are associated with the action itself, not the entity. They have their own configuration, and you&rsquo;re not required to store their values in the record (though you can copy the value to a record field within the action script if needed). Linked parameter: These fields are part of the entity&rsquo;s structure and settings, which means their structure and settings cannot be altered (except for display options in views). If the Saved linked parameters flag is enabled, these fields will be automatically updated in the record before executing the action script, which then triggers a record changed event. Entity field parameter: These parameters are also part of the entity but are not directly linked to the action. Instead, they are used within the context of the action and can be accessed through the record variable. For more information on configuring parameters, please refer to the Fields documentation.
Permissions # Permissions dictate which groups are granted the authority to execute the action. As with other aspects of the application, these permissions are enforced both in the UI and the REST API.
Upon adding a new action to an entity, if a group has permissions for all the actions in that entity, the action is automatically granted the Allowed permission.
Permissions for parameters can be configured within each parameter or at the group level.
Upon adding a new parameter to an action, if a group has permissions for the action, read-write permission is automatically assigned to that parameter within the group.
For more details on permissions, please consult the Groups documentation.
Views # To enable the execution of an action from the UI, a view must be defined. To simplify this process, a default view is automatically generated alongside the action. This default view is fully managed, meaning that new fields will be added or removed as you modify your actions. In most scenarios, you can simply rely on the default action views.
However, it&rsquo;s possible to define multiple views for a single action based on different settings required for various parts of the UI. For example, in a grid view, you might want to prompt users for confirmation before executing an action, since they can select multiple records. On the other hand, in a read-only view, skipping action confirmation can enhance efficiency.
Each view comes with the following settings:
Label: A user-friendly name for the action view, which users will see as the action&rsquo;s name. This label doesn&rsquo;t need to be unique. Name: A unique name for the action view, which cannot contain spaces or special characters. Is default view: Indicates whether this is the default view for the action. Default views are used, for instance, when you opt to display all actions in a grid view. In this case, only the default view of each action is listed, as it wouldn&rsquo;t make sense to display all views of each action in the same place. Managed: If this option is enabled, new parameters will be automatically incorporated into the view, and the order will be maintained between action parameters and the view. Ask for confirmation: Enabling this flag prompts users for confirmation before executing the action. This is useful when no parameters are defined in the view. Style: Specifies the style of the action button in the UI. Icon: Defines the icon displayed for the action in the UI. Events # Before show # The before show script is evaluated before the action is executed. In the UI, it runs before displaying the popup to the user, allowing you to make changes to parameters based on special conditions.
If multiple records are selected, the script is executed only once. You can determine which records will be affected by using the query parameter within the script.
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the action will be executed.
This variable is only available if the type of the action is One record or if you are appliying the action to many records. query sys.data.Query A query object with filters to find all records afected by this action. Only for type Many records. action sys.data.Action This allows access to the parameters of the action. When the action is executed from the UI, changes made here will be reflected in the UI. Samples # // sets the default value as the email of the current user action.field('sendTo').val(sys.context.getCurrentUser().email()); On action change # The on action change script is evaluated each time a view parameter&rsquo;s value changes. Therefore, it is possible to modify parameters based on specific conditions.
You can identify the parameter that triggered the event by utilizing the modifiedParameter parameter within the script.
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the action will be executed.
This variable is only available if the type of the action is One record or if you are appliying the action to many records. In case of on change event the record is read only. action sys.data.Action This allows access to the parameters of the action. When the action is executed from the UI, changes made here will be reflected in the UI. modifiedParameter string A string with the name of the field that fires the event. Samples # // sets the value as the email of the current user only if the field 'sendTo' has changed and is empty if (modifiedParameter == 'sendTo' &amp;&amp; action.field('sendTo').isEmpty()) { action.field('sendTo').val(sys.context.getCurrentUser().email()); } After action executed # The after action executed script is evaluated immediately after the user confirms the execution of the action (or when they initiate the action if the Ask for confirmation flag is not set). It&rsquo;s important to note that this evaluation occurs exclusively when the action is executed through the UI using this specific view.
If multiple records are selected, the script is executed only once. You can ascertain which records will be affected by employing the query parameter within the script.
Furthermore, if the action is dispatched to the background for execution, a job object becomes accessible. This job object refers to the job responsible for carrying out the action over the record(s).
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the action will be executed.
This variable is only available if the type of the action is One record or if you are appliying the action to many records. query sys.data.Query A query object with filters to find all records afected by this action. Only for type Many records. action sys.data.Action Action object to access parameters of the action. job sys.jobs.job This is the job object, which is only available when the action is executed in background.
Keep in mind that the after action executed script is executed right after you triggered the action from the UI and the job might be still pending or running. Samples # // after action is executed redirect to read only view of given record var record = sys.data.findOne(query); sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'global', name: 'navigate', view: '590ce2e38a2....', recordId: record.id() }); `}),e.add({id:61,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/data-model-and-logic/listeners/",title:"Listeners",description:`Listeners allow you to connect with various events within the app. For instance, you can listen to the creation of records or the reception of an event from an legacy service and take certain actions when these events occur.

Type # The listener type indicates the category of events it will be observing. The available types include:
Data: Data listeners can tap into data-related events such as record creation, record updates, or the execution of actions on records. When selecting this type, additional settings can be configured to filter the specific data events to be handled: Entity: The listener will focus on events within records under this entity. Events: Specifies which data events the listener will process. Refer to the Data events for more details. Legacy service: Legacy service listeners can intercept events sent from legacy services. For example, an HTTP legacy service can generate an event when a webhook is triggered, which can then be processed by a listener. When choosing this type, further settings can be customized to filter the events to be managed: Legacy services: The listener will be attuned to events generated by this specific legacy service. Event: Indicates the specific event to be considered. UI plugin: These listeners can capture events and callbacks originating from UI plugins. When opting for this type, you can specify additional settings to filter the events to be handled: Plugin: The plugin to which the listener will be attuned. Event: The event/callback emanating from the plugin. Job: Job listeners can respond to user events like job start or job completion. When selecting this type, additional settings can be defined to filter the job events to be handled: Job: The category of job that the listener will be observing. Event: Specifies the particular event to be considered. Time: Time listeners execute based on a CRON expression. When selecting this type, additional settings can be configured: Timezone: The timezone employed for the CRON expression. Expression: The expression determining when the listener will execute. For more information on the expression format, please review this documentation. Execute in the background # For certain event types (such as Data), you can decide whether the listener should execute synchronously or be sent to the background.
For instance, if this flag isn&rsquo;t enabled and the listener pertains to a record creation, the operation won&rsquo;t conclude until the listener&rsquo;s execution is finished. Therefore, you should enable this flag when the listener&rsquo;s execution might surpass an acceptable time frame for the ongoing operation.
Avoid Triggering UI events # Enabling this flag ensures that when the listener is triggered in the background, it bypasses sending notifications to the UI. This feature proves valuable in avoiding additional overhead during execution. A typical use case is executing a listener for batch processing, where notifying end users about data changes isn&rsquo;t necessary.

This allows your app to seamlessly leverage the functionalities provided by these external services.
Global vs. user legacy services # There are two categories of legacy services:
Global legacy services: These legacy services boast a universal configuration for the entire app, irrespective of the user. For instance, the SparkPost legacy service falls under this category as its operations aren&rsquo;t tied to any specific app user. User legacy services: These legacy services feature both a global configuration and an individual configuration per user. This configuration is managed within the My integrations tab under My profile in the app runtime. This distinction becomes crucial when the external service necessitates awareness of the user initiating the calls. For instance, most Google legacy services require users to grant permissions so that all operations are executed on the user&rsquo;s behalf. Consider the Google Calendar legacy service configuration; each user must grant permission to access it. Two key considerations when employing user legacy services are: Valid Current User for Method Calls: When calling a method in the legacy service&rsquo;s API, the current user within the execution context must be connected to the legacy service. Failure to meet this requirement will result in an error. For instance, if a user creates a new record in a contacts entity, and the Slingr app user hasn&rsquo;t connected the Google Contacts endpoint, the attempt to create the contact in Google will fail. User-Based Event Generation: Events generated per user might lead to multiple events when you expect only one. For example, with a Google Contacts endpoint and a Contact updated event listener, creating a new contact in Google results in an event per user, rather than a single event. This means that if 10 users in your app are connected to the Google Contacts endpoint, you will receive 10 events, assuming all 10 users have permission to view the new contact. This behavior acknowledges that each user may have varying levels of access in the external system based on settings or security rules. This way, users without access to specific content won&rsquo;t receive irrelevant events, sparing the need to replicate security rules within your app. Legacy service configuration # While there are certain shared settings among legacy services, each legacy service may have distinct additional settings. Documentation for each specific legacy service should be consulted for detailed explanations of these settings.
Here, we will elucidate common settings.
Label # This stands as the human-readable legacy service name, serving no operational purpose during app execution.
Name # This internal legacy service name is used within the JavaScript API.
The name should exclusively consist of letters and numbers, with no special characters or spaces.
It&rsquo;s worth noting that altering the legacy service name could have ramifications for scripts referencing the legacy service. For example, if the name changed from slack to something like slackmaster, calls like app.endpoints.slack.* might need to be updated to app.endpoints.slackmaster.*. Although we intend to provide tools to assist in such cases, for now, changes must be made manually.
Initial status # This signifies the legacy service&rsquo;s initial status when first pushed or synced. This setting exclusively affects the initial deployment. Once the legacy service is pushed or synced, its status remains unchanged and should be modified through the app monitor.
This flag is particularly useful when constructing template apps that will be cloned, but you wish to delay legacy service deployment until they are configured. Thus, the initial status can be set to Undeployed, ensuring it remains inactive until configured and deployed.
Profile # Profiles represent distinct deployment configurations for a legacy service, encompassing resource allocation and other necessities. For instance, a Slack legacy service might feature profiles like Default, Medium team, and Big team, each accommodating a different number of concurrent Slack team users. The legacy service documentation should provide a comprehensive description of each profile, aiding in selecting the suitable one.
This setting is only applicable to legacy services that support multiple profiles.
Force end user configuration # This flag is exclusive to user legacy services. When enabled, users logging into the app will be prompted to configure the legacy service for their accounts. Although users can postpone this process and configure it later, the configuration screen will appear whenever they log in.
Groups # Applicable only to user legacy services, this setting designates which groups are permitted to use the legacy service. Selection can be made from all groups or specific ones. Users must belong to at least one selected group to access the legacy service; otherwise, the legacy service will be invisible to them.
Legacy service-specific configuration # In addition to common settings, legacy service-specific configuration options should be explored in each legacy service&rsquo;s documentation. These typically encompass credentials and configurations influencing legacy service behavior.
Due to the environment-dependent nature of legacy services, employing environment variables for configuration, especially for sensitive information like credentials, is advisable. This facilitates the use of distinct accounts for development and production.
Secure legacy service-specific configuration # Storing sensitive data, such as passwords and keys, in environment variables is highly recommended. Configuration properties can then reference these environment variables. For further details, consult the documentation on Environment Variables.
Legacy service properties # For all configured legacy services, several properties prove useful to developers in certain scenarios. These properties are accessible through the app.endpoints.&lt;endpointName&gt; namespace, where endpointName represents the legacy service&rsquo;s name. While some are endpoint-specific, a couple of generic properties exist:
_name # This is the internal name of the legacy service, used within the JavaScript API.
_configuration # This property contains a JSON representation of the legacy-service-specific configuration.
_token # This token is employed to validate messages exchanged between the legacy service and the platform.
For example, if a legacy service is named fullcontact, the properties can be accessed like this:
sys.logs.info(JSON.stringify(app.endpoints.fullcontact)); Or having a legacy service called ftp you can print the _token:
sys.logs.info(app.endpoints.ftp._token); Legacy services usage # When a legacy service is added, it introduces two new features to the app:
Functions: These functions can be invoked from any script and are typically used to send and retrieve data from an external app. Events: These events are triggered by the external app and can be handled through listeners. By creating listeners for legacy services, you can intercept and process these events. Functions # Legacy service functions are accessible from any script using the namespace app.endpoints.&lt;endpointName&gt;, where endpointName refers to the legacy service&rsquo;s name. For instance, if there&rsquo;s a legacy service named slack that offers a function called sendMessage(), you can call it from any script using app.endpoints.slack.sendMessage().
For instance, the following is an example of a call to send a message using the Slack legacy service:
const msg = action.field('message').val(); app.endpoints.slack.sendMessage({channel: '#test', message: msg}); If errors occur during the execution of a function, an exception will be raised. By default, this exception halts the execution of the script, and the error is logged. However, you have the option to handle it if desired:
const msg = action.field('message').val(); try { app.endpoints.slack.sendMessage({channel: '#test', message: msg}); } catch (e) { sys.logs.warn('There was a problem sending a message through Slack: '+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)); } // execution will continue even if the message to Slack couldn't be sent You should refer to each legacy service&rsquo;s documentation to identify the functions that are available.
For example, to learn about the functions provided by the Slack legacy service, consult the Slack legacy service&rsquo;s documentation.
User legacy service functions # For user legacy services, most function calls are likely to be tied to a specific user. For instance, consider the case of using the Google Contacts user legacy service. When creating a new contact within this legacy service, it needs to be added to the Google account of the user currently utilizing the app.
This determination hinges on the current user within the execution context (you can check this using the script: sys.context.getCurrentUser(). In the aforementioned example, when invoking the function to create a contact in Google Contacts, the legacy service identifies the current user and performs the contact creation on behalf of that user. Naturally, this assumes that the current user has previously connected to the legacy service; otherwise, the function call will fail.
There are instances where the current user might be the system user. In such cases, if you attempt to call a legacy service method requiring association with a user, the call will fail. If you possess the information about the user intended for this function call, you can set it using the method sys.context.setCurrentUser() before calling the legacy service&rsquo;s function.
All user legacy service incorporate the following functions:
connectUser(config): Establishes a connection between the current user and the legacy service. Here, config pertains to the user&rsquo;s configuration for that specific legacy service. For instance:
const msg = {}; msg.configuration = {}; msg.configuration.code = 'user-code'; // code generated on the authentication page by the user try { const response = app.endpoints.googleContacts.connectUser(msg, { 'userConnected': function(event) { sys.logs.info('User connected to Google Contacts: '+sys.context.getCurrentUser().fullName()); sys.logs.info(' - Configuration: '+JSON.stringify(event.data.configuration)); }, 'userDisconnected': function(event) { sys.logs.info('Could not connect user to Google Contacts:'+sys.context.getCurrentUser().fullName()); } }); sys.logs.info('Response: '+JSON.stringify(response)); } catch(e) { sys.logs.error('Error when try to execute function ['+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)+']'); } disconnectUser(): disconnects the current user from the endpoint. For example:
const msg = {}; try { const response = app.endpoints.googleContacts.disconnectUser(msg, { 'userDisconnected': function(event) { sys.logs.info('User disconnected from Google Contacts:'+sys.context.getCurrentUser().fullName()); } }); sys.logs.info(&quot;Response: &quot;+JSON.stringify(response)); } catch(e) { sys.logs.error('Error when try to execute function ['+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)+']'); } isUserConnected(): returns true if current user is connected to the endpoint, false otherwise. For example:
if (app.endpoints.googleContacts.isUserConnected()){ sys.logs.info('User connected'); } else { sys.logs.info('User disconnected'); } Callbacks # Certain functions offer callbacks that enable easy handling of asynchronous responses. For instance, when utilizing the function to send an email with Mandrill, you can include a callback to perform an action when a reply to the email is received:
let msg = {}; msg.subject = &quot;A test subject.&quot;; msg.templateName = &quot;test-template&quot;; msg.important = true; msg.to = &quot;user1@test.com&quot;; msg.globalMergeVars = { companyName: record.field('name').val(), companyId: record.id() }; msg.waitResponse = true; try { let callbackData = {company: record, currentUserEmail: sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord().field('email').val()}; let response = app.endpoints.mandrill.sendEmail(msg, callbackData, { responseArrived: function(event, data) { // event data sys.logs.info('Response arrived:'); sys.logs.info('Date/Time: '+event.data.eventTime); sys.logs.info('From: '+event.data.fromName+' &lt;'+event.data.fromEmail+'&gt;'); sys.logs.info('Subject: '+event.data.subject); sys.logs.info('Text: '+event.data.text); // callback data sys.logs.info('Record ID: '+data.company.id()); sys.logs.info('User email: '+data.currentUserEmail); } }); sys.logs.info(&quot;Mandrill response: &quot;+JSON.stringify(response)); } catch(e) { sys.logs.error('Error when try to send an email: '+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)); } When callbacks are supported, two parameters are available at the end:
callbackData: This object can be sent, and it will be returned when the callback is processed. This is crucial because, in the function processing the callback, access to variables outside the function is restricted. For instance, in the previously provided code, referencing the variable msg outside the callback function isn&rsquo;t feasible. This limitation arises due to the asynchronous nature of callbacks, causing a loss of context, which differs from standard JavaScript behavior. Hence, it&rsquo;s important to keep this in mind. callbacks: This map allows you to listen for various callbacks. The earlier example only listens to the responseArrived callback. However, the Mandrill legacy service can trigger additional callbacks based on diverse events. Functions within this callback possess two parameters: event: This encompasses the event information, identical to the event available in listeners. Refer to the documentation on Legacy service Listeners. data: This constitutes the callback data dispatched when the function was called. Please consult each legacy service&rsquo;s documentation to ascertain the available callbacks for each function.
Events # Events signify occurrences within the external app that require notification. These events can originate from the external app itself, or the legacy service might identify certain events and relay them to the app. For instance, this could involve a message sent to a Slack channel or the FTP legacy service detecting a new file in a monitored folder.
Events can be managed via Legacy service Listeners. Each legacy service provides its own distinct events; therefore, consulting the documentation for each legacy service is advised.
User legacy service events # A key aspect regarding user legacy services pertains to event processing. When events arrive, the current execution context is aligned with the user from whom the event originated. Consequently, during event handling within the listener, if you invoke 'sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord()' you will get the user associated to the event:
const currentUser = sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord(); sys.logs.info('*** EVENT FOR USER: '+currentUser.field('email').val()); Keep in mind that there might be global events in a user legacy service, so in those cases current user will be null. You should check that in the legacy service&rsquo;s documentation.
Finally, user legacy services have two additional events that are always available:
User connected: indicates that a user connected to the legacy service, which usually means that the user granted permissions. This event has some information about the configuration that you can get at event.data.configuration:
sys.logs.info('User connected to Google Calendar: '+sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord().field('email').val()); sys.logs.info(' - Configuration: '+JSON.stringify(event.data.configuration)); User disconnected: indicates that a user disconnected from the legacy service.

Services configuration # All services share some common settings, although each service may have additional settings that are specific to its functionality. It&rsquo;s important to refer to the service&rsquo;s documentation for a detailed explanation of these settings.
Here, we will describe some of the common settings:
Label # This is the human-readable name of the service, primarily for organizational purposes and does not impact the app&rsquo;s execution.
Name # This is the internal name of the service, used in the JavaScript API. It should not contain special characters or spaces, only letters and numbers. Be cautious when changing the service name, as it may require updates in scripts that reference it.
Instance type # The HTTP service, for instance, offers two instance types: dedicated and shared. Shared instances do not require deployment configuration and use a platform component, while dedicated instances have specific components deployed for exclusive app usage, incurring additional costs.
Initial status # This represents the initial status of the service when it is first pushed or synced. It only affects the service&rsquo;s first deployment. Afterward, the status should be managed through the app monitor. This feature is particularly useful for template apps that will be cloned; you can set the initial status to &lsquo;Undeployed&rsquo; to delay activation until it&rsquo;s configured and deployed.
Service properties # All configured services offer properties that can be valuable for developers. These properties are organized under the svc.&lt;serviceName&gt; namespace, where serviceName corresponds to the name of the service. While some properties are service-specific, there are also a couple of generic properties:
Name # This is the internal name of the service, used in the JavaScript API.
Configuration # This JSON representation holds service-specific configurations.
Token # This token is used to validate messages exchanged between the service and the platform.
For example, if you have a service named 'fullcontact,' you can access its properties as follows:
sys.logs.info(JSON.stringify(svc.fullcontact)); Or having an service named ftp you can print the _token:
sys.logs.info(svc.ftp._token); Service usage # Functions # Service functions are callable from any script and are accessed via the svc.&lt;serviceName&gt; namespace, where serviceName corresponds to the name of the service. For instance, if a service named &lsquo;pdfGenerator&rsquo; provides a function called 'generatePdf()', you can invoke it from any script using the following syntax: svc.pdfGenerator.generatePdf().
For example, here&rsquo;s a GET request using the HTTP service:
const resquest = 'https://www.slingr.io/'; var response = svc.http.get({url:request}); log(JSON.stringify(&quot;Response: &quot; + response)); During the execution of a function, if errors occur, an exception will be thrown. By default, this exception halts the execution of the script, and the error is logged. However, you have the option to handle errors if desired.
Please refer to each service&rsquo;s documentation to identify the available functions and their respective error handling mechanisms.
Callbacks # Some functions provide callbacks that facilitate the receipt of asynchronous responses. For example, when generating a PDF file using a PDF generator, you can incorporate a callback to perform actions once the image is returned:
try { let userName = sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord().label(); let callbackData = {company: record, currentUserEmail: sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord().field('email').val()}; let response = svc.pdf.generatePdf({}, callbackData, { responseArrived: function(event, data) { // event data sys.logs.info('Response arrived:'); sys.logs.info('event: '+JSON.stringify(event)); // callback data sys.logs.info('Record ID: '+data.company.id()); sys.logs.info('User email: '+data.currentUserEmail); } }); sys.logs.info(&quot;Pdf response: &quot;+JSON.stringify(response)); } catch(e) { sys.logs.error('Error when try to generate a pdf file: '+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)); } When callbacks are supported, two parameters are available at the end:
callbackData: This is an object that you can send and will be returned when the callback is processed. This is important because, in the function processing the callback, you won&rsquo;t have access to any variables outside the function scope. For instance, in the code above, you won&rsquo;t be able to reference the userName variable because it exists outside the callback function. This limitation arises because callback execution is asynchronous, resulting in a different context compared to regular JavaScript code. Keep this in mind when working with callbacks.
callbacks: This is a map where you can register listeners for various callbacks. In the example above, it&rsquo;s listening only for the responseArrived callback, but certain services, like Mandrill, can trigger multiple callbacks based on different events. Functions within this callback have two parameters:
event: This parameter contains event information, identical to the event data available in listeners. Please refer to the service&rsquo;s documentation for details on service-specific events. data: This parameter holds the callback data that was sent when the function was initially called. Please consult each service&rsquo;s documentation to determine the available callbacks for each function.
Events # Events signify occurrences within the service or an external app that require notification. These events can be triggered by the external app itself or detected by the service, prompting it to send an event to the app. For instance, an event might be generated when a message is sent to a Slack channel or when the FTP service detects a new file in the watched folder.
Events can be managed through service listeners. Each service offers its own set of events, so it&rsquo;s essential to consult the service&rsquo;s documentation for specific event details.

The most common use cases for packages include importing utility libraries to perform common operations and connecting your application with external services by sending, receiving, and fetching data via their APIs. Packages contain all the logic necessary for utilizing an HTTP service and consuming these external APIs. For instance, there are packages available for Slack, Google Contacts, Google Calendar, and other popular cloud services, allowing your application to seamlessly leverage the features offered by these apps.
Package installation and management # Available packages for your application can be found in a section called the &quot;Marketplace.&quot; From there, you can read the package README.md to learn more and install the package. Once a package is installed, you can monitor it for updates to ensure you&rsquo;re using the latest version.
Package configuration # While all packages share some common settings, each package may also have additional settings specific to its functionality. It&rsquo;s essential to refer to the package&rsquo;s documentation to understand the meaning of these settings.
Here, we will describe common settings:
Label # This is the human-readable name of the package and does not impact the execution of your application.
Name # This is the internal name of the package, used in the JavaScript API. It should not contain special characters or spaces, only letters and numbers. Be cautious when changing the package name, as it may require updates in scripts that reference the package.
Version # This indicates the current version of the package.
Upgrade policies # This setting defines how the package behaves when new versions are available. Versions follow the format X.Y.Z. The available options are:
Compatible version: Shows updates when the Y or Z values are updated. Bug fixes: Shows updates when the Z value is updated. Manual: Updates won&rsquo;t be shown for new versions. Latest: Shows updates for any version change. Package-specific configuration # In addition to common settings, each package may have its own configuration settings. These settings often include credentials and configurations that determine the package&rsquo;s behavior. Packages might be environment-dependent, so consider using environment variables for configurations such as credentials to allow for different accounts in production and development environments.
Package dependencies configuration # Packages that depend on services require selecting a service instance for the package to use. This selected service will also be the target of imported listeners.
Secure packages-specific configuration # For security, it&rsquo;s highly recommended to use environment variables to store sensitive information like passwords and keys. You can then configure a specific property to reference an environment variable. Please refer to the &ldquo;Environment Variables&rdquo; section for more information.
Data storage # Some packages may need to generate and store information during runtime securely. For instance, a GitHub package might need to store credentials securely after user authentication. In such cases, the package will encrypt and store this information in the app&rsquo;s storage.
Using packages # When a package is added, it introduces new features to your application:
Script Libraries: Functions within these libraries can be called from any script and belong to the script libraries imported by the package.
Events: These events are triggered by the package and can be processed through Package Listeners. When creating a listener for packages, you will see the package and its associated events, allowing you to handle them effectively.
Listeners: Listeners are useful for processing events, such as validating and formatting content received via webhooks through an HTTP service, and then triggering package-related events.
UI Services: These services provide client-side functionality, such as enabling OAuth 2.0 connections to external services from the application runtime.
Flow Steps: Flow steps introduced by packages can be used in any application flow.
All of these elements can be explored in the metadata tree of the builder within the &ldquo;Packages&rdquo; section.
Script libraries # Package libraries can be invoked from any script and are located under the namespace pkg.&lt;packageName&gt;, where packageName corresponds to the name of the package. For instance, if a package named &lsquo;slack&rsquo; provides a library called &lsquo;messages,&rsquo; you can call a function like &lsquo;sendMessage()&rsquo; from any script using the following syntax: pkg.slack.messages.sendMessage().
For example, here&rsquo;s a call to send a message using the Slack legacy service:
const msg = action.field('message').val(); pkg.slack.messages.sendMessage({channel: '#test', message: msg}); In case of errors during the execution of a function, an exception will be thrown. By default, this exception will halt the script&rsquo;s execution, and the error will be logged. However, you have the option to handle errors if necessary:
const msg = action.field('message').val(); try { pkg.slack.messages.sendMessage({channel: '#test', message: msg}); } catch (e) { sys.logs.warn('There was a problem sending a message through Slack: '+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)); } // execution will continue even if the message to Slack couldn't be sent To discover the available libraries and functions within each package, it&rsquo;s essential to refer to the respective package&rsquo;s documentation. Each package may offer a unique set of libraries and functions tailored to its specific functionality.

When you create a new group, it doesn&rsquo;t automatically come with any pre-set permissions.
Groups are also employed in OAuth Scopes. Before removing a group, ensure it is not currently used in an OAuth Scope. For more information, consult the OAuth Support documentation.
Next, we will delve into the configuration settings for a group.
Label # This represents the human-readable name of the group. You can utilize spaces, special characters, and a mix of upper and lower case letters.
The label is used for referencing the group within the user interface. Generally, changing the label of a group doesn&rsquo;t necessitate code modifications. However, if you&rsquo;ve employed it in scripts or via the REST API, manual updates might be required.
Name # This denotes the internal name of the group. It must exclude special characters or spaces.
Typically, the group name is utilized in scripts and the REST API. Changing it could potentially impact your app, demanding certain manual adjustments.
Entity permissions # Each entity is associated with a set of permissions, dictating permissible actions, as well as the accessibility of fields and actions.
When a new entity is introduced, it doesn&rsquo;t come with any default permissions assigned to any group.
Let&rsquo;s now explore the permissions applicable to entities.
Can create # Indicates if users can generate new records for the entity.
Creation options include:
Always: Users can create records within the entity regardless of field values (as long as they adhere to validation rules). Condition: Users can solely create records that meet a specified condition. For example, a user might only create tickets assigned to themselves. Refer to Expressions for defining conditions. Never: Users are prohibited from creating records within this entity. Can access # Indicates whether users can retrieve records from the entity. Access permissions take precedence over other permissions. For instance, if you possess editing permissions for a record but lack access permissions, editing becomes unfeasible. The same principle applies to deletion, history tracking, and exporting.
Access options encompass:
Always: Users have access to all records within the entity. Condition: Users can solely access records meeting a given condition. For instance, a user might access only tickets assigned to them. Refer to Expressions for condition definition. Never: Users lack access to records within this entity. Can edit # Indicates whether users can modify records within the entity. Users must also have access permissions for a record to be editable.
Editing options encompass:
Always: Users can edit any record within the entity. Condition: Users can solely edit records that meet a specified condition. For instance, a user might edit solely those tickets assigned to them. Refer to Expressions for condition definition. Never: Users lack permission to edit records within this entity. History access # Indicates whether users can view historical logs of records within the entity. Access permissions for the record must also be present to view its history.
History access options include:
Always: Users can view historical logs of all records within the entity. Condition: Users can solely view history logs of records meeting a specified condition. For instance, a user might view history logs of tickets assigned to them. Refer to Expressions for condition definition. Never: Users lack access to history logs of records within this entity. Can import # Indicates whether users can import records via a CSV file. User must also have creation permissions; otherwise, record creation would fail.
Can export # Indicates whether users can export records to a CSV file. Export is only possible for records the user possesses access to.
Field permissions # Field permissions can be specified for each field. Options encompass:
Parent: Field permissions replicate those of the parent field. This solely applies to fields nested within other fields and is the default setting. Read/Write: Users within this group can both read from and write to this field. Read Only: Users within this group can solely read this field. Any attempts to alter the value during updates are silently discarded. None: Users within this group have neither read nor write permissions for this field. The field is entirely concealed from the UI and REST API. Advanced: This allows for separate read or write access configurations, optionally dependent on record data via expressions, filters, or scripts. This mirrors the functionality of Read/Write Access for fields. Upon introducing a new field to an entity, if a group has update access to the entity (Can Create or Can Edit is set to Always or Condition), the field is automatically assigned read-write permission for that group. If there&rsquo;s solely read access to the entity (Can Access is set to Always or Condition), read-only permission is assigned to the field for that group. No permissions are automatically set otherwise.
Action permissions # Action permissions are configured similarly to advanced field configurations. This implies that configuration can be influenced by record configuration. Action permissions comprise the following options:
Always: The action is always executable. Script: The action becomes executable if the script returns true; otherwise, it remains inexecutable. The script operates within the context of: Parameters Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This is the record associated to the operation. If field is inside an entity field, this will be the record that contains the field.
If the field is an action parameter, this will be the record where the action is being executed.
parentField sys.data.Record This variable is only available when this is a field inside a nested field and it is based on the variable record or action (the same rules apply then it is an action parameter or an entity field).
It is a sys.data.Record object with the difference that the root of the record is set to the nested fields containing it. This way it is possible to access fields in the nested group like parentField.field('fieldA') instead of record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'), which is specially needed when nested fields are multi-valued as you don&rsquo;t know the index.
action sys.data.Action This variable will be available only if the field is an action parameter. It will provide access to other parameters. Returns boolean - You should return true if there is access to the field, false otherwise. Samples// if &rsquo;numberOfExmployees&rsquo; is bigger than 10, then this field is visible return record.field('numberOfEmployees').val() > 10; Expression: The action is executable if the expression evaluates to true. Further details about expressions are available in the Expressions documentation. Never: The action cannot be executed. This option is meaningful only when the relevant flag is unchecked. Upon adding a new action to an entity, if the group holds permissions for all actions within that entity, the newly added action is granted permission as well.
It&rsquo;s also feasible to establish permissions for action parameters, following the same criteria as Field Permissions. When introducing a new parameter to an action, if a group possesses permissions for the action, read-write permission is automatically extended to the parameter within that group.
View permissions # Specify which views users can see and employ. For proper functioning, the user should also possess access permissions for the relevant entity. Consequently, adding a view automatically results in permissions for the associated entity if none were initially defined.
When you create a new view, if a group holds permissions for the entity linked to that view (applicable to grid, record, and card views), the view is automatically granted permission for that group&rsquo;s usage.
Security settings # Secure access # Allowed IPs # Define a whitelist of IPs from which users can log in. If a user attempts to log in or access the app from an IP outside this whitelist, an error will be generated.
If a user belongs to multiple groups, each defining valid IPs, any of these IPs will be deemed valid.
Password rules # These rules stipulate the prerequisites for a valid password. Only rules established in the user&rsquo;s primary group are enforced.
Require upper case # If enabled, passwords must include an uppercase character.
Require lower case # If enabled, passwords must include a lowercase character.
Require number # If enabled, passwords must contain a numerical digit.
Require symbol # If enabled, passwords must incorporate a special character.
Require minimum length # If enabled, the minimum length for a valid password can be specified.
Password policies # Only policies set in the user&rsquo;s primary group are taken into account.
Password expiration # Specifies the frequency at which users are required to change their passwords. Setting this value to Never means users are never prompted to reset their passwords (which is the default setting).
Maximum login attempts # Sets the maximum number of consecutive failed login attempts allowed per user. If this limit is exceeded, the user&rsquo;s access will be blocked.
Impersonate users # Determines whether users can impersonate other users. Enabling this feature allows them to execute operations on other users, such as editing, password resets, unblocking, and more. This applies to both the REST API and the UI. The UI gains a new menu item in the secondary menu titled Impersonate Users.

User permissions and authentication settings are determined by the groups to which they belong. For further insights, please refer to the documentation on Groups.
User settings # The following system user fields are created by default. Furthermore, custom fields can be created within this entity.
First name # Refers to the user&rsquo;s first name.
Last name # Represents the user&rsquo;s last name.
Email # Denotes the user&rsquo;s email address. This email must be unique within the app, and notifications will be dispatched to this address. Therefore, it&rsquo;s imperative to ensure the email provided is valid.
It&rsquo;s worth noting that certain identity providers might utilize the email address for user identification.
Send welcome email # This flag is exclusively available during the creation of a new user. When activated, a notification containing login instructions is dispatched to the user.
Authentication # This section pertains to settings associated with user session authentication.
Password # This refers to the password utilized by the user to log in using the default Slingr identity provider.
When creating a new user, the Generate Password flag can be selected to automatically generate a password.
Two-Factor authentication # Two-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security, necessitating not just a password and username, but also a unique piece of information known solely to the user. This could be a physical token, for instance.
Users can activate this feature within their own profiles by scanning the QR code generated using Google Authenticator on their mobile devices. Additionally, a phone number is required to enable SMS-based recovery of the authentication code, in case the user changes their mobile device.
Groups # This section displays the groups to which the user belongs. Each user must have one and only one primary group.
Identity providers # This section showcases the identity providers configured for the user. You can add or remove identity providers, and also modify the external ID associated with each provider.

Google # The Google identity provider enables users with Google accounts to log in to your application.
Service account of google # To generate a service account in Google, follow these steps:
Go to the Google Cloud console and log in as a super administrator. Create a project in the Google Cloud console. Activate the APIs for the service account. Create a service account in the Google Cloud console. Assign roles to the service account to provide access to GCP resources. Client ID # When you create a service account, a unique and permanent ID is automatically generated. A service account name is provided in the email address format: SA_NAME@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com. This value serves as the Client ID that you need to configure in the Slingr app.
OAuth redirect URI # The OAuth redirect URI is the URI you need to configure in your Google Cloud console, in the same Google service account you created earlier. The standard format is: https://&lt;appName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;environment&gt;/runtime/api/sso/google/&lt;providerName&gt;/consumer.
Default user group # If it is allowed to create users when signing in through this identity provider, any new user created will be automatically assigned to this group.
After configuring app settings in Slingr and applying the changes, a &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo; button will automatically appear on the login page of the app.
When a user clicks the button, a popup will open, allowing the user to select their Google account to use for signing in.
Slack # The Slack identity provider permits Slack users to log in to your app.
Allow login with any team # This setting defines which Slack users can sign in. Enabling it allows any user to log in. Disabling it requires specifying a list of allowed teams using their IDs (not domains). The team ID can be obtained via the Web API by setting the request token in Extra args as token=XYZ123. For further information, refer to Legacy tokens in the official documentation.
Use default slack application # If you opt not to create a Slack application, the default one provided by Slingr can be used. However, creating a custom Slack application enables branding and personalized app names for users signing in with Slack.
To use a custom Slack application, provide the following settings:
Client ID: ID of the custom Slack application. Client Secret: Secret of the custom Slack application. Redirect URI: URI configured in your custom Slack application. For details on creating a Slack application, consult the documentation at Getting started with Slack apps and Sign in with Slack. The sign-in button is pre-implemented in Slingr!

SAML # SAML is an open-standard data format for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties (see Security Assertion Markup Language).
SAML is commonly used in corporate environments, allowing users to access your Slingr app without needing to log in again, thanks to centralized user management.
Login URL # Provide the URL for user sign-in, provided by the SAML identity provider.
Change password URL # Provide the URL for changing user passwords, provided by the SAML identity provider.
Certificate # Supply the certificate used to validate the authenticity of tokens. Copy the certificate content as-is.
Synchronize only external groups # Enabling this option synchronizes only the groups added by the identity provider in the past. If a user belongs to groups A, B, and C, but only C was added by the identity provider, adding group D won&rsquo;t remove A and B.
Attribute mapping # Attribute mapping specifies how attributes from the identity provider map to user attributes. The default mapping assumes the presence of the following attributes:
userId: Immutable ID from the identity provider (used as the user&rsquo;s external ID). userEmail: User&rsquo;s email in the identity provider. userFirstName: User&rsquo;s first name in the identity provider. userLastName: User&rsquo;s last name in the identity provider. userGroups: Groups to which the user belongs in the identity provider, separated by commas. For custom mapping, a script context is provided. Parameters include idpAttributes for attributes from the SAML identity provider. The script should return an object containing attributes such as userId, userEmail, userFirstName, userLastName, and userGroups.
If you decide to provide a custom mapping, here is the context of the script:
Parameters # Name Type Description idpAttributes object This object contains all the attributes comming from the SAML identity provider. For example if the identity providers sends an attribute with name firstName, you should be able to access it using idpAttributes.firstName. Returns # object - The script should return an object with the following attributes:
userId: immutable ID from identity provider. This will be set as the external ID of the user for this identity provider. userEmail: email of the user in the identity provider. userFirstName: first name of the user in the identity provider. userLastName: last name of the user in the identity provider. userGroups: groups that user belongs to in the identity provider.

The ultimate goal is to empower developers to craft compelling UIs without getting bogged down in intricate details and boilerplate code.
Unlike many low-code platforms where developers still need to manually assemble UI elements within a form, carefully manage layout, and establish connections between the UI and data/operations, Slingr takes a different approach. While this approach might represent progress beyond raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it often demands considerable time and effort, particularly when the app model undergoes changes.
To simplify UI creation, Slingr introduces substantial building blocks called &ldquo;views&rdquo;. These views present diverse methods for presenting information, each tailored to distinct use cases. For instance, grid views are available for listing records, and workflow views are suitable for displaying records as cards within a dashboard. Each view offers a variety of parameters that can be adjusted to suit different scenarios.
These views are designed to extract as much information as possible from the app model, reducing the need for redundant tasks. For example, views can automatically decipher entity structures to construct forms or apply default display settings to fields.
The app&rsquo;s UI is structured as follows:
Header: This section resides at the top, displaying the app name and logo (customizable). In the builder, it can also incorporate a browser for entities, actions, listeners, and more. Main menu: The app&rsquo;s primary menu contains the different sections of your application. Selecting an item triggers the display of a corresponding view in the main content area. Secondary menu: This menu accommodates items linked to app views that are rendered in the main content area. User menu: In addition to containing system operations such as My profile or Logout, this menu permits the inclusion of items associated with app views rendered in the main content area. Main content: This region is where app views are showcased. Configuration options for the left and top menus are accessible through the Navigation section in the app builder. Conversely, adjustments to the header and certain other global settings can be made within the UI settings section.
Here are the available types of views:
Grid views Workflow views Record views Action views Custom views `}),e.add({id:79,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/user-interface/navigation/",title:"Navigation",description:`Navigation within your app refers to how users can access different views.

Secondary Menu: Found in the top-right area of the app, this menu allows you to add menu items (without menu groups) that will appear to the left of the User menu. User Menu: Located at the top-right corner, this menu serves as the platform for various system actions like My profile or Logout. You can include menu items (without menu groups) that will be positioned above the Logout action. Certain components provide supplementary navigation features (e.g., relationship fields enabling the jump to other records). These features are explained within each respective component&rsquo;s documentation.
Menu item # Menu items direct users to specific views within the app. When clicked, the associated view will be displayed in the main content area.
Menu items possess the following configurable settings:
View: This indicates the target view for the menu item. Label: The text to display in the menu. The default value is the same as the view&rsquo;s label. Icon: An optional icon for the menu item. Leave this field blank if no icon is desired. Expression: This permits the addition of filtering expressions to the chosen view. This feature is valuable when different collection views for the same entity only differ in the filtering expression. Refer to the Expressions documentation for guidance on filter configuration. For record views, you will be prompted to provide a script to select the record to be displayed in the view:
Returns # string - The ID of the record to be showcased in the record view.
Samples # // finds one record based on current user var settings; if (sys.context.getCurrentUser().isPrimaryGroup('Testing')) { settings = sys.data.findOne('settings', {type: 'test'}); } else { settings = sys.data.findOne('settings', {type: 'prod'}); } return settings.id(); Dynamic menu item # Dynamic menu items are equipped with a script that generates a list of menu entries. Each entry will be incorporated into the menu at the position of the dynamic menu entry.
Dynamic menu items entail the subsequent settings:
Label: This label serves as an identifier for the menu item.
Script: This script must yield an array of menu items. It can leverage app data to ascertain which entries will be accessible and their attributes. This includes information like the associated views, labels, icons, and additional options such as filters.
Returns # object [] - An array of menu items. Each item should encompass the following details:
label: This label will be displayed in the menu. icon: The icon&rsquo;s name (you can reference icon names here). view: The ID or name of the view to be loaded upon selecting the menu entry. filters: If the view supports filters, this is where you can define them. Samples # // returns a list of menu items that point to Companies view var menuEntries = []; //this entry shows only active companies menuEntries.push({ label: 'Active Companies', icon: 'account-circle', view: 'companies', filters: { active: 'true' } }); // this entry shows only inactive companies menuEntries.push({ label: 'Inactive Companies', icon: 'flower', view: 'companies', filters: { active: 'false' } }); // this entry shows all the companies (no filter applyed) menuEntries.push({ label: 'All the Companies', icon: 'case', view: 'companies' }); return menuEntries; Menu group # Menu groups offer the ability to contain multiple menu items, allowing you to logically group related items under a single label in the menu.
Menu groups come with the following configuration options:
Label: The label to be displayed in the menu. Icon: An optional icon. If you prefer not to have an icon, you can leave this field blank. It&rsquo;s important to note that this functionality is applicable solely to the main menu.

Name # The internal name of the view. This name must exclude special characters and spaces.
Commonly, this view name is utilized in scripts and the REST API. Altering it may impact your application and necessitate manual adjustments.
List settings # Behavior # These settings determine the behavior of the listing.
Sort field # This defines the default sorting field for the listing.
Users may be able to modify the default sorting if enabled in any of the columns.
Sort type # Specifies the sorting direction.
Users may be able to change the default sorting if enabled in any of the columns.
Page size # This signifies the maximum number of records fetched when the view is loaded or when users click on More to fetch additional records.
Infinite scroll # Enables automatic retrieval of more records as users scroll down.

Show filters # When enabled, filter controls are displayed beneath the header of each column, enabling users to filter records in the listing.
Fixed header # Activating this option locks the grid header, allowing users to retain visibility while scrolling downward.
Main menu # This setting governs the actions executable from the view header.
Available options include:
All: All view-related actions in the entity will appear in the context menu. Some: A custom selection of actions is presented. A new selector, Available actions, emerges, allowing you to pick which actions will be listed (you can select the actions&rsquo; views here). Custom Menu: Developers can customize action rendering. Actions can be grouped. Top-level groups will be rendered as dropdown buttons, while nested groups will be nested dropdowns. Various configuration options for button behavior during runtime are available, such as Label, Default options (which allows overriding of predefined configuration), Only icon, Icon, Style, and Label of action. System Actions Only: Only system actions like CRUD, Import, and Refresh will be displayed. None: No actions will be available. In all scenarios, action permissions and preconditions will be verified. Some actions may remain hidden if the user lacks the requisite permissions or preconditions are unmet.
Record menu # This option regulates the actions executable from the listing itself. They appear when users click the Actions button on the secondary menu of the listing or in the actions column when Display Record Menu Column is enabled.
Available options include:
All: Every action in the entity is displayed under the Actions button on the secondary menu or in the actions column. Note that the default view of each action is used in this scenario. Some: A custom selection of actions is available. A new selector, Available actions, allows you to pick which actions will be listed (you can select the actions&rsquo; views here). System Actions Only: Only system actions like CRUD, Import, and Refresh will be displayed. None: No actions will be available. In all cases, action permissions and preconditions will be verified. Some actions may remain hidden if the user lacks the requisite permissions or preconditions are unmet.
Display record menu column # When enabled, the last column of the listing serves as an actions column. It features a dropdown button that includes CRUD actions (edit, view, and delete), along with actions configured in the grid view. This permits quick execution of an action for a specific record without the need for prior selection.
Allow to rank records # Enabling this option enables sorting of records through drag-and-drop within the listing (utilizing arrows on the left of each row). To use this feature, the entity must possess a field of type Rank.
The following settings must be configured when this option is enabled:
Rank Field: The rank field utilized for sorting records in the list.
Rank Type: Specifies how ranking will be performed. Auto defers the decision to the platform, permitting records to be moved to any position. Select Manual to have more control and use a script to define ranking rules. This is beneficial for imposing restrictions or special rules. For example, if issues have dependencies, tasks with dependencies on other tasks cannot be above those dependent tasks. If Manual is selected, a script must be provided for context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This pertains to the record that is undergoing movement. Typically, you will update the rank field within this record using the methods available in the wrapper methods. It&rsquo;s important to remember that after updating the rank field, you must save the record. Failing to save the record will result in the rank not being updated, and the record will not be repositioned. recordBefore sys.data.Record This refers to the record that precedes the intended position for the record being moved. It might be null in instances where the record is being moved to the first position, as there would be no preceding record. recordAfter sys.data.Record This denotes the record following the intended position for the record being moved. It could be null when moving the record to the last position, as there would be no succeeding record. Samples # // rank records in a way that urgent ones are always at the top var fieldName = 'rank'; var moved = false; if (!recordBefore &amp;&amp; recordAfter) { // the record is moved to the top if (!recordAfter.field('urgent').val() || record.field('urgent').val()) { record.field(fieldName).rankBefore(recordAfter.field(fieldName)); moved = true; } } else if (recordBefore &amp;&amp; !recordAfter) { // the record is moved to the bottom if (recordBefore.field('urgent').val() || !record.field('urgent').val()) { record.field(fieldName).rankAfter(recordBefore.field(fieldName)); moved = true; } } else if (recordBefore &amp;&amp; recordAfter) { // the record is placed between two other records if ((!recordAfter.field('urgent').val() || record.field('urgent').val()) &amp;&amp; (recordBefore.field('urgent').val() || !record.field('urgent').val())) { record.field(fieldName).rankBetween(recordBefore.field(fieldName), recordAfter.field(fieldName)); moved = true; } } // IMPORTANT!!! You need to save the record to make the new rank value permanent if (moved) { sys.data.save(record); } Record highlight # The &ldquo;Record Highlight&rdquo; option allows you to specify which records should be visually highlighted using colors. This is particularly helpful when you want users to quickly notice certain records. For instance, in a task listing, you might want to emphasize urgent tasks by assigning them a distinctive red color.
Multiple highlight rules can be defined. For each rule, a color must be chosen, and an expression must be provided. All records that match the expression will be displayed using the selected color.
For more details on expressions, please refer to the Expressions documentation.
Alternatively, you have the option to use a script instead of an expression:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This represents the record that will undergo evaluation to determine if it should be highlighted. Returns # boolean - You should return true if the record should be highlighted, and false if it should not be highlighted.
Samples # // the task will be highlighted if it is urgent return record.field('urgent').val() == true; Lookup field # The lookup field influences the construction of the record&rsquo;s URL. By default, the ID is utilized, resulting in the following URL structure:
https://&lt;app&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/#views/&lt;viewId&gt;/readOnly/&lt;recordId&gt; When a lookup field is chosen, the recordId is substituted with the value of the lookup field. For instance, if the name field is selected as the lookup field, and the value of the opened record is test1, the resulting URL would be:
https://&lt;app&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/#views/&lt;viewId&gt;/readOnly/test1 The lookup field must have the unique flag set.
Automatic refresh # Enabling this option creates a dynamic listener that ensures the view refreshes automatically for all users when a record belonging to the entity this view points to is created, updated, or deleted. This applies whether the event is triggered by a user or a script. Enabling this feature for a card view also enables it for its corresponding CRUD read-only view.
Filtering settings # Record filters # This section defines the criteria for listing records. Only records that match the provided expression will appear in the grid view.
Global search # For entities with global search enabled, you can enable the Enable global search flag to allow users to utilize this feature.
Columns # This section allows you to add or remove fields as columns in the listing&rsquo;s table. These columns will initially utilize the default display options of the associated fields, but you can override these options. Refer to the documentation on General Display Options for more details.
Columns offer additional options beyond those available for fields:
Automatic Width: Determines if the column&rsquo;s width should adapt automatically based on available space and content, or if it should have a fixed width, either in pixels or as a percentage. Allow Title Wrapping: By default, titles won&rsquo;t wrap unless this flag is enabled, which can be useful for fields with lengthy labels (you can also override the field&rsquo;s label in display options). Allow Sorting: Indicates whether sorting arrows will be present for this column. This flag is set by default for fields with the indexable flag activated. CRUD actions # Grid views support creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. This section allows you to configure these actions.
If the entity has child entities, you can configure different views for each entity type. For instance, if you have entity A and its children entities A1 and A2, creating a record view for A lets you configure views for A1 and A2. As a result, when you create a grid view for entity A, you&rsquo;ll see records from A1 and A2. The displayed record view depends on the type of record you open.
Create # Allow to create** # This action is used to generate new records within the entity. When enabled, a button for creating new records will appear in the listing. For entities associated with this view&rsquo;s entity that have child entities, a button dropdown displaying available options will be shown.
You can configure the record view for creating a new record by clicking Configure View. For more details, refer to the Record Views Documentation.
Open in modal** # Enabling this flag displays the new record creation view in a modal instead of replacing the listing as the main content.
Show next button** # When this option is enabled, apart from the Cancel and Save buttons, a Next button will appear when creating a new record. This button saves the record and immediately shows the form for creating another new record. This feature proves useful for rapid creation of multiple records.
Selected view** # This setting allows you to select the view for the create CRUD action. Available options for selection include create-type record views of the current entity or custom views. If you opt for a Custom View, a JSON context with information will be conveyed through a message event. To utilize this information in the custom view, add an event listener in the custom view&rsquo;s main file. Additionally, when the Create action button is pressed, a message event is triggered to inform the custom view. The custom view can listen for this event and perform an action. This add event is also triggered after executing other custom actions.
Sample of a listener set in a custom view in order to obtain some context information
window.addEventListener('message', function (event) { //We wait for a message from the platform to let us know the Create Button has been pressed if (event.data.eventType) { if (event.data.eventType === 'add') { //This is a method we should implement to save the new data and then comunicate it back to the platform self.createRecord(); } // Logs the context. This happened once the custom view is fully rendered }else if(event.data.context){ var context = event.data.context; var entity = event.data.context.entity; sys.logs.info(&quot;CONTEXT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(context)); } }); Once you&rsquo;re listening for the add event, you can proceed to implement specific functionalities. Custom views offer a utility method for creating new records and subsequently notifying the platform. Additional details on this can be found in the Custom View section.
Sample of an implementation of a createRecord() method
self.createRecord = function () { console.log('creating new record from REST API'); //Custom view method to create a record and inform back to the platform sys.ui.createRecord(entity.name, newRecord, function (recordCreated) { console.log(&quot;ON SUCCESS RECORD: &quot; + JSON.stringify(recordCreated)); }, function (error) { console.log(&quot;ON ERROR :&quot; + JSON.stringify(error)); }) }; Read # Allow to see details # Enabling this action permits users to open a record from the listing. When enabled, users can click on a record within the listing to view its details. Additionally, the View action will be visible in the action column (if enabled).
You can configure the record view to display details by clicking Configure View. For more information, refer to the Record Views Documentation.
Open in modal # If this flag is set, the view for seeing details of records will be presented in a modal, instead of replacing the listing as the main content.
Selected view # This setting enables you to choose the view for the read-only CRUD action. Available options for selection include read-only record views of the current entity or custom views. If you opt for a Custom View, a JSON context with information will be conveyed through a message event. To utilize this information in the custom view, add an event listener in the custom view&rsquo;s main file. Furthermore, when the Refresh action button is pressed, a message event is triggered to inform the custom view. The custom view can listen for this event and perform an action. This refresh event is also triggered after executing other custom actions.
Sample of a listener set in a custom view in order to obtain some context information
// Logs the context and the event type window.addEventListener('message', function (event) { if(event.data.eventType){ var eventType = event.data.eventType; sys.logs.info(&quot;EVENT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(eventType)); }else if(event.data.context){ var context = event.data.context; sys.logs.info(&quot;CONTEXT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(context)); } }); Update # Allow to edit # Enabling this action enables users to edit a record from the listing. When enabled, users will observe an Edit button in the read view of the record (the read action must be enabled), and they will also see the Edit action in the action column (if enabled).
You can configure the record view for editing by clicking Configure View. Refer to the Record Views Documentation for detailed information.
Open in modal # If this flag is set, the view for editing records will be displayed in a modal, instead of replacing the listing as the main content.
It&rsquo;s important to note that if the read view isn&rsquo;t configured to be shown in a modal, it won&rsquo;t appear as a modal when accessing the edit view from the read view. This setting solely applies when clicking the Edit option in the action column of the listing.
Selected view # This setting allows you to choose the view for the update CRUD action. Available options for selection include edit-type record views of the current entity or custom views. Opting for a Custom View sends a JSON context with information through a message event. To leverage this information in the custom view, add an event listener in the custom view&rsquo;s main file. Moreover, pressing the Save action button triggers a message event to inform the custom view about the save button being pressed. Consequently, the custom view can listen for this event and execute an action. This edit event is also triggered after performing other custom actions.
Sample of a listener set in a custom view in order to obtain some context information
window.addEventListener('message', function (event) { //We wait for a message from the platform to let us know the Save Button has been pressed if (event.data.eventType) { if (event.data.eventType === 'edit') { //This is a method we should implement to save the new data and then comunicate it back to the platform self.updateRecord(); } // Logs the context. This happened once the custom view is fully rendered }else if(event.data.context){ var context = event.data.context; var entity = event.data.context.entity; var contextRecord = event.data.context.record; sys.logs.info(&quot;CONTEXT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(context)); } }); Once you&rsquo;re listening for the edit event, you can proceed to implement specific functionalities. Custom views offer a utility method for updating records and subsequently notifying the platform. Additional details on this can be found in the Custom View section.
Sample of an implementation of a updateRecord() method
self.createRecord = function () { console.log('creating new record from REST API'); //Custom view method to create a record and inform back to the platform sys.ui.createRecord(entity.name, newRecord, function (recordCreated) { console.log(&quot;ON SUCCESS RECORD: &quot; + JSON.stringify(recordCreated)); }, function (error) { console.log(&quot;ON ERROR :&quot; + JSON.stringify(error)); }) }; Delete # Allow to delete # Enabling this action allows records to be deleted. When enabled, a Delete button will be visible in the listing. This button permits the deletion of all selected records. The Delete option will also appear in the action column dropdown and in the read view.
Sub-Grids # Sub-grids are valuable for representing one-to-many relationships. Consider a scenario where you have customers and each customer can have multiple contacts. In this case, you could include contacts as a sub-grid within the customers&rsquo; view.
When the read view of a record is opened, sub-grids will be displayed below the main record.
Sub-grids possess the following attributes:
Title: This title identifies the sub-grid in the user interface. Entity: This is the entity that the sub-grid points to. It must have a relationship field pointing to the entity of the main grid view. Related Field: This is the relationship field that establishes a connection from the sub-grid&rsquo;s entity to the entity of the main grid view. Condition: This permits conditional display of the sub-grid. For instance, you might want to display the orders sub-grid only when the customer is active. Options for conditions are: None: The sub-grid will always be displayed.
Expression: This defines an expression that the record in the main grid view must satisfy to display the sub-grid.
Script: This enables you to create a script to determine whether the sub-grid should be displayed. The context for this script is:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This is the record in the main grid view. Returns # boolean - You should return true if the sub-grid has to be displayed, false otherwise.
Samples # // only show contacts if customer is active return record.field('state').val() == 'active'; The configuration of sub-grids is identical to that of the main view. There&rsquo;s only a small behavioral difference when creating a new record: the field configured in Related Field will be pre-populated with the record from the main view.
Filters # Global filters # If the Allow Global Filters flag is enabled, the user interface allows users to filter records in the grid based on the fields indicated in Global Filter Fields.
Override label # When Allow Global Filters is enabled, the Global Filter Fields section includes an Override Label flag, which allows overriding the default filter label (which is the field label).
Enable global search # Enabling this option displays a search box above the listing that facilitates filtering fields using the global search feature. This feature finds words in any field of the record.
This option is only available if the entity has global search enabled.
Quick filters # Quick filters provide an effortless way to further filter the collection of records by clicking or unclicking buttons. Refer to Expressions for additional information.
Permissions # Permissions enable the definition of groups that can access this view.
Permissions for a view can be managed directly in the view definition, although it represents a different perspective of what can be configured in groups. This approach facilitates easy configuration of permissions for all existing groups.
When a new view is created and a group has permissions for the entity associated with that view, the view automatically receives permission for usage by that group.
For more comprehensive information about permissions, please consult the Groups Documentation.

Records are allocated to respective columns based on their status. Users possess the capability to shift cards across columns as they progress through tasks, arrange cards within columns to indicate priority, and more.
Workflow views offer the following functionality:
Creation of new records Access to record details Editing of records Execution of actions These capabilities parallel those of grid views. The fundamental distinction lies in the visual representation of records. In a workflow view, records appear as cards within a board, as opposed to a traditional list format.
To facilitate the transition of records from one column to another, transitions must be defined. Transitions hinge on an associated action, executed upon the movement of a record.
Finally, customization options extend to card rendering. Developers can configure the appearance of cards by modifying the title, content, and tags.
Entity # This specifies the entity to which the view is linked. Only records belonging to this entity will be listed within the grid view.
Label # This represents the human-readable name of the view. You can use spaces, special characters, and a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters.
The label will be displayed at the top of the grid view, so choose something comprehensible to users.
Name # The internal name of the view. This name must exclude special characters and spaces.
Commonly, this view name is utilized in scripts and the REST API. Altering it may impact your application and necessitate manual adjustments.
Columns # Columns form the structural foundation of workflow views. Primarily, columns mirror different states that records can assume, although they can also be based on alternate criteria.
Label # This label designates the column&rsquo;s title, displayed at the top of the column in the user interface.
Sort field # This indicates the default sorting field for the column.
Sort type # Specifies the sorting direction.
Width # This signifies the column&rsquo;s width, which can be specified in pixels or as a percentage. When using a percentage, the reference point is the width of the main content area. If pixel values are employed and the width exceeds the available space, horizontal scrolling will be enabled to navigate through other columns.
Filters # Filters enable the specification of criteria for which records will be displayed in the column. Consequently, only records matching the expressions defined within the filters will appear in the column. For instance, if the column pertains to To do, a filter might be placed on records with a state field equivalent to toDo (or any other applicable filter condition).
For comprehensive details and configuration instructions regarding filters, consult the Expressions documentation.
Page Size # This designates the maximum number of records to be initially fetched and when users scroll through the list.

Samples # // rank records in a way that urgent ones are always at the top var fieldName = 'rank'; var moved = false; if (!recordBefore &amp;&amp; recordAfter) { // the record is moved to the top if (!recordAfter.field('urgent').val() || record.field('urgent').val()) { record.field(fieldName).rankBefore(recordAfter.field(fieldName)); moved = true; } } else if (recordBefore &amp;&amp; !recordAfter) { // the record is moved to the bottom if (recordBefore.field('urgent').val() || !record.field('urgent').val()) { record.field(fieldName).rankAfter(recordBefore.field(fieldName)); moved = true; } } else if (recordBefore &amp;&amp; recordAfter) { // the record is placed between two other records if ((!recordAfter.field('urgent').val() || record.field('urgent').val()) &amp;&amp; (recordBefore.field('urgent').val() || !record.field('urgent').val())) { record.field(fieldName).rankBetween(recordBefore.field(fieldName), recordAfter.field(fieldName)); moved = true; } } // IMPORTANT!!! You need to save the record to make the new rank value permanent if (moved) { sys.data.save(record); } Transitions # Transitions outline the process by which cards can be relocated from one column to another. Without a defined transition for card movement between columns, such movements cannot be facilitated within the user interface.
The following settings pertain to transitions:
Label: This serves as a label for identifying the transition. Source Column: Indicates the column from which cards will be dragged. Target Column: Specifies the column to which cards will be dropped. Action: This pertains to the action executed upon card drop. If the action encompasses parameters, a modal will prompt the user to complete the form and confirm the action. In cases where the action lacks a confirmation requirement, it will automatically execute, bypassing the confirmation flag. It&rsquo;s crucial to note that the action bears the responsibility of altering the record in a manner that situates it in the new column. For example, if the transition enables the transfer of a record from the To do column to the In progress column, the action must modify the task&rsquo;s state from toDo to inProgress. Failure to update the record within the action, for any reason, will result in the record being returned to its original column.
Card settings # Card settings dictate the visual presentation of cards, encompassing elements such as headers, content, and tags.
Header # The header is located at the top of the card. It should be concise (commensurate with the column&rsquo;s configured width) and provide sufficient information for users to identify the record.
Two methods exist for defining the header:
Field: Selection of a field within the entity, with the field&rsquo;s value serving as the header.
Script: In instances where a more intricate header, combining different fields, is necessary, a script can be employed. The script&rsquo;s context is as follows:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record that the card is representing. Returns # string - Plain text that will be used as the header.
Samples # // builds the header using the task number and summary return record.field('number').val() + '. ' + record.field('summary').val(); Summary # The summary is displayed within the card&rsquo;s body. While it should offer more comprehensive details about the record, an effort should be made to maintain brevity, ideally limiting the content to three lines or fewer. In cases where content exceeds this limit, vertical scrolling will be enabled within the card&rsquo;s body.
Two approaches exist for defining the summary:
Field: Selection of a field within the entity, with the field&rsquo;s value serving as the summary.
Script: In instances where a more intricate summary, involving the combination of different fields, is necessary, a script can be employed. The script&rsquo;s context is as follows:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record that the card is representing. Returns # string - HTML code that will be rendered in the body of the card. Keep in mind that HTML tags allowed are the same as for HTML type.
Samples # // builds the summary using different fields var summary = ''; if (record.field('description').isEmpty()) { summary += 'No description'; } else { summary += record.field('description').val(); } if (!record.field('attachments').isEmpty()) { summary += 'Attachments' summary += ''; record.field('attachments').each(function(attachment) { var url = sys.app.getUrl()+'/api/files/'+attachment.id(); summary += ''+attachment.name()+'' }); summary += ''; } return summary; Tags groups # Tags are situated at the base of the card, comprised of a label and a color. They serve as a means to swiftly highlight aspects within the card. For instance, urgent tasks could be designated with a red tag labeled &lsquo;urgent,&rsquo; allowing users to promptly identify them.
Label # This label designates the tags group, providing a means of signifying the significance of the tag group.
Filter # This filter specifies which records may possess this tag. However, the presence of this filter does not necessarily guarantee that records will bear the tag. Additional considerations might stem from the label script or the absence of content within the label field.
For comprehensive information and guidance on configuring filters, consult the Expressions documentation.
Color # This denotes the color employed for the tag. These colors are aligned with the theme.
Tags # The subsequent options are available for tags:
Fixed Text: A single tag with the provided text.
Field: The value of the designated field serves as the tag label. If the field is multi-valued, a tag will be added for each value. Should the field be empty, no tags will be appended.
Script: This option allows the definition of tags using a script. Essentially, the script should return either a string (a single tag) or a list of strings (multiple tags).
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record that the card is representing. Returns # string|string[] - This is the text to show in the tag. If the script returns a string, it will considered one tag. If the script returns an array of strings, many tags will be added.
Samples # // adds the company state as tag return record.field('company').fetch().field('state').val(); Record Highlight # This option empowers you to designate records that should stand out through the application of colors. This proves invaluable when seeking to draw users&rsquo; swift attention to specific aspects. For instance, in a task listing, urgent tasks could be highlighted in red, facilitating rapid identification.
Multiple highlight rules can be established. For each rule, a color must be selected, and an associated expression must be defined. Any records that satisfy the expression will be presented with the chosen color.
For comprehensive details and guidance on expressions, refer to the Expressions documentation.
Alternatively, a script can be employed in place of an expression:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record that the card is representing and that will be evaluated to see if it has to be highlighted. Returns # boolean - You should return true if the record has to be highlighted, false otherwise.
Samples # // the task will be highlighted if it is urgent return record.field('urgent').val() == true; Main menu # This option governs the actions that can be executed from the view header.
The available options are:
All: All available action views associated with the entity will be displayed in the context menu. Some: A customized selection of actions will be accessible. This introduces a new selector called Available actions, which is employed to choose which actions will be listed (the corresponding views of these actions are selected here). Custom menu: This option provides developers with the ability to customize how actions are presented. Actions can be grouped into logical categories. Top-level groups will appear as dropdown buttons, while nested groups will form nested dropdowns. Several runtime behavior configurations for buttons are available: Label: Solely applicable to Groups. Groups can be assigned a label. Default options: If disabled, certain configuration aspects of the action views can be overridden. Only icon: Relevant to top-level elements. Buttons can be displayed with only icons. Icon: Overrides the predefined icon associated with the action. If left empty, the icon is not overridden. Style: Overrides the predefined style associated with the action. If left empty, the style is not overridden. Label of action: Overrides the label of the action. If left empty, the label is not overridden. System Actions Only: Only system actions such as CRUD, Import, Refresh, etc., will be shown. None: No actions will be available. In all cases, permissions and preconditions of actions will be verified, potentially resulting in the hiding of certain actions if the user lacks the requisite permissions or preconditions are not met.
Record menu # This option governs the actions that can be executed from each card. These actions will be displayed in the context menu associated with each card (identifiable through the three vertical dots in the upper-right corner of the card).
The available options are:
All: All available action views associated with the entity will be displayed in the context menu of the cards. Some: A customized selection of actions will be accessible. This introduces a new selector called Available actions, which is employed to choose which actions will be listed (the corresponding views of these actions are selected here). System Actions Only: Only system actions such as CRUD, Import, Refresh, etc., will be displayed. None: No actions will be available. In all cases, permissions and preconditions of actions will be verified, potentially resulting in the hiding of certain actions if the user lacks the requisite permissions or preconditions are not met.
Automatic refresh # When this flag is enabled, a dynamic listener will be established to enable automatic refreshing of this view for all users whenever a record belonging to the entity to which this view is directed is created, updated, or deleted. Whether the event is initiated by a user or a script, this feature remains effective. By enabling this feature on a card view, it is simultaneously enabled on its corresponding CRUD read-only view.
CRUD actions # Workflow views support the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of records. In this section, you can configure these actions.
If the entity encompasses child entities, distinct views can be configured for each type of entity. For instance, if Entity A has entities A1 and A2 as its children, creating a record view for A facilitates the configuration of views for entities A1 and A2.
Consequently, a card view for Entity A will display records from A1 and A2. Depending on the type of record opened, the corresponding record view will be displayed.
Create # Allow to create # This action facilitates the creation of new records within the entity. Enabling this option introduces a button that allows the creation of new records within the listing. If the entity associated with the view has child entities, a button dropdown displaying available options will be presented.
The configuration of the record view for creating new records can be accessed by clicking Configure View. For a comprehensive understanding of record views, consult the Record Views documentation.
Open in modal # When enabled, this flag ensures that the view for creating a new record is displayed in a modal window rather than replacing the listing as the primary content.
Show next button # Enabling this option introduces a Next button alongside the Cancel and Save buttons when creating a new record. Selecting Next not only saves the current record but also promptly displays the form to create a new record. This feature streamlines the process of creating multiple records.
Read # Allow to view details # This action enables users to access a detailed view of a record from the listing. Enabling this option permits users to click on a record within the listing to view additional details. Furthermore, the View action will be available in the action column (if enabled).
The configuration of the record view for detailed viewing can be accessed by clicking Configure View. For detailed insights into record views, refer to the Record Views documentation.
Open in modal # When enabled, this flag ensures that the detailed view of records is displayed in a modal window rather than replacing the listing as the primary content.
Update # Allow to edit # This action facilitates the editing of records from within the listing. Enabling this option will present an Edit button within the detailed view of a record (which requires the read action to be enabled). Additionally, the Edit action will be available in the action column (if enabled).
The configuration of the record view for editing can be accessed by clicking Configure View. For a comprehensive understanding of record views, consult the Record Views documentation.
Open in modal # When enabled, this flag ensures that the view for editing records is displayed in a modal window rather than replacing the listing as the primary content. It&rsquo;s important to note that if the read view is configured to not show in a modal, this setting will not be applied when accessing the edit view from the read view. This setting primarily applies when clicking on Edit in the action column of the listing.
Delete # Allow to delete # This action empowers users to delete records. When enabled, a Delete button will be visible within the listing, allowing users to delete selected records. This button will also appear in the action column&rsquo;s dropdown and in the detailed view.
Filters # Global Filters # If the Allow Global Filters flag is enabled, users can filter cards on the board based on the fields specified in Global Filter Fields.
Override label # When Allow Global Filters is enabled, the Override Label flag is available on Global Filter Fields, allowing for the customization of the filter label (by default, the label corresponds to the field label).
For entities with enabled global search, it is possible to activate the Allow Global Search flag.
Quick filters # Quick filters enable effortless card filtering through the simple act of clicking or unclicking buttons.
For more information, consult Expressions.
Permissions # Permissions determine which groups can access this view.
While permissions for a view can be configured directly within the view definition, it mirrors the capabilities available in group configuration. The objective is to facilitate easy permission configuration for all existing groups.
Upon the creation of a new view, if a group holds permissions for the entity associated with that view, the view will inherently be granted permission for use by that group.
For a comprehensive understanding of permissions, refer to the Groups documentation.

By default, the current month is displayed, but you can navigate through different months and switch between various views to see weeks and days.
From within calendar views, you can perform actions such as creating new records, viewing details of individual records, editing records, and executing actions—similar to the functionalities available in grid and card views. The key distinction is that instead of presenting records as a list or arranging them as cards in columns, they are presented as events on a calendar.
Furthermore, you have the capability to configure the appearance of events by customizing their titles and colors.
Entity # This specifies the entity to which the view is linked. Only records belonging to this entity will be listed within the grid view.
Label # This represents the human-readable name of the view. You can use spaces, special characters, and a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters.
The label will be displayed at the top of the grid view, so choose something comprehensible to users.
Name # The internal name of the view. This name must exclude special characters and spaces.
Commonly, this view name is utilized in scripts and the REST API. Altering it may impact your application and necessitate manual adjustments.
Calendar settings # Allow event editing # This flag indicates whether the duration of an event can be edited from the calendar view.
Record filters # Filters allow you to specify which records will be displayed as events on the calendar. Only records that match the expressions specified in the filters will be included in the view. For instance, if the calendar is intended to show events in a To do status, you would likely apply a filter to include records where the state field equals toDo (or any relevant criteria).
Please refer to the Expressions documentation for detailed information on configuring these filters.
Automatic refresh # Mark this option to enable automatic refreshing of the view when a record event occurs.
Record settings # Here you can configure the record events. This configuration will be applied to each displayed record in the view.
From field # Select the From field from the entity to be used for determining the event start on the view. This field is mandatory.
To field # Select the To field from the entity to be used for determining the event end on the view. This field is mandatory.
All day record field # Select a field from the entity that indicates whether this record represents an All day event. This field can only be of boolean type.
Title # Choose the event title type. It can be either Field or Script.
Field # Select the Title from the entity to be used as the event label on the view. This field is available and required only if Title is set to Field.
Script # Manually set the event label on the view by providing a script that must return a String value. This field is available and required only if Title is set to Script. The script operates in the following context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the event title is being calculated. Returns # string - You should return a string to be used as event title.
Samples # // builds the title using last name and description return record.field('lastName').val() + ': ' + record.field('description').val(); Highlight default color # Define the record color for each event.
Main menu # This option controls the actions that can be executed from the view header.
The available options are:
All: Show all available actions for the entity in the event context menu. Some: Allow a custom selection of actions. A new selector called Available actions will appear. This can be used to choose which actions to list (you select the action views here). Custom Menu: Developers can customize how actions are displayed. Actions can be grouped, with root-level groups shown as dropdown buttons and nested groups as nested dropdowns. There are additional options to configure button behavior at runtime. Label: For Groups only. Groups can have labels. Default Options: If false, it allows the override of certain action view configurations. Only Icon: For root-level elements only. Buttons can be displayed with only the icon. Icon: Overrides the predefined icon of the action. If empty, the icon won&rsquo;t be overridden. Style: Overrides the predefined style of the action. If empty, the style won&rsquo;t be overridden. Label of Action: Overrides the label of the action. If empty, the label won&rsquo;t be overridden. System Actions Only: Display only system actions like CRUD, Import, Refresh, etc. None: No actions will be available. In all cases, permissions and preconditions of actions will be checked. Some actions might be hidden if the user lacks permissions or if preconditions aren&rsquo;t met.
Record menu # This option controls the actions that can be executed from each event. These actions will be shown in the context menu belonging to each event.
The available options are:
All: Show all available entity actions in the event context menu. Some: Allow a custom selection of actions. A new selector called Available actions will appear. This can be used to choose which actions to list (you select the action views here). System Actions Only: Display only system actions like CRUD, Import, Refresh, etc. None: No actions will be available. In all cases, permissions and preconditions of actions will be checked. Some actions might be hidden if the user lacks permissions or if preconditions aren&rsquo;t met.
Record highlight # In this section, you can configure various record colors to distinguish records on the calendar. This differentiation can be based on defined preconditions. If no conditions are met, the record will adopt the highlight default color.
Color # Select the color to be applied to the event.
Color activation type # Choose how the color precondition will be expressed. Available options are Expression and Script.
Filter # Only records matching the expressions specified in the filter will be assigned the selected color. Please refer to the Expressions documentation for comprehensive guidance on configuring these filters. This setting is available and required only if Color activation type is set to Expression.
Script # Manually determine whether the color should be applied to the event. Provide a script that returns a Boolean value. This setting is available and required only if Color activation type is set to Script. The script operates within the following context:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record where the event title is being calculated. Returns # boolean - You should return a boolean to know if the color should be applied.
Samples # // apply the color only to the records that has a description return record.field('description').val() !== ''; CRUD actions # From calendar views, you can perform the create, read, update, and delete actions on records. This section allows you to configure these actions.
If the entity has child entities, you can configure different views for each type of entity. For example, if you have entity A, and entities A1 and A2 are its children, creating a record view for entity A enables configuring the view for entities A1 and A2.
In this manner, if you create a calendar view for entity A, it will display records from A1 and A2. Depending on the record type you open, the corresponding record view will be displayed.
Create # Allow creation # This action is used to create new records in the entity. Enabling this will provide a button to create new records in the listing. If the entity associated with the view has child entities, a button dropdown with available options will be displayed.
You can configure the record view for creating a new record by clicking on Configure view. Please refer to the documentation on Record Views.
Open in modal # If this flag is set, the view for creating a new record will appear in a modal instead of replacing the listing as the main content.
Show next button # If this option is enabled, while creating a new record, in addition to the Cancel and Save buttons, a Next button will be shown. This button will save the current record and immediately display the form for creating the next record. This is useful when users need to create multiple records rapidly.
Read # Allow viewing details # This action is used to open a record from the listing to view details. Enabling this allows users to click on a record in the listing to see its details. The View action will be displayed in the action column (if enabled).
You can configure the record view for viewing details by clicking on Configure view. Please refer to the documentation on Record Views.
Open in modal # If this flag is set, the view for displaying record details will be shown in a modal instead of replacing the listing as the main content.
Update # Allow editing # This action is used to edit a record from the listing. Enabling this displays an Edit button in the read view of the record (this requires the read action to be enabled), and it also shows the Edit action in the action column (if enabled).
You can configure the record view for editing by clicking on Configure view. Please refer to the documentation on Record Views.
Open in modal # If this flag is set, the view for editing records will be displayed in a modal instead of replacing the listing as the main content.
Please note that if the read view isn&rsquo;t configured to display as a modal, it won&rsquo;t be displayed in a modal when accessing the edit view from the read view. This setting only applies when clicking on the Edit action in the listing&rsquo;s action column.
Filters # Global filters # When the Allow Global Filters flag is enabled, the UI permits users to filter cards on the board by the fields specified in Global Filter Fields.
Override label # When Allow Global Filters is enabled, within Global Filter Fields, a flag called Override Label allows overriding the default filter label (which is the field label).
Quick Filters # Quick filters enable you to further filter the collection of cards easily by clicking/unclicking buttons.
Permissions # Permissions define which groups can access this view.
While permissions for a view can be managed directly in the view definition, they can also be configured within groups. This approach makes it easy to configure permissions for all existing groups specifically on the view.
When a new view is created, if a group has permissions for the entity associated with that view, then the view inherits permission to be used for that group.

Before show # This event is triggered before presenting the record to the user. For instance, you could effect changes to the record or log that the user accessed the record before its display.
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record This is the record that will be shown in the view. Any modifications you make here will be reflected in the UI. You don&rsquo;t need to explicitly save these changes; they will be applied instantly. However, if you choose to save these changes, they will become permanent.

Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record on which the action will be executed. This variable is exclusively accessible if the action type is set to &quot;One record&quot; or if you are applying the action to multiple records. query sys.data.Query A query object containing filters to locate all records affected by this action. This is applicable only for the &quot;Many records&quot; action type. action sys.data.Action This provides access to the parameters of the action. Changes made here will be reflected in the UI when the action is executed from the user interface. job sys.jobs.Job This is the job object, exclusively accessible when the action is executed in the background. Keep in mind that the After Action Executed script is run immediately after triggering the action from the UI. At this point, the associated job might still be pending or running.

These custom views will be displayed as iframes within the main content area of your app. This grants you the freedom to integrate any CSS and libraries you require, without needing to be concerned about conflicts with the app&rsquo;s components.
Custom views provide a Javascript API, simplifying interaction with the app. This API facilitates tasks such as fetching information, executing operations, and redirecting to other views.
Please note that to use the Javascript API, it&rsquo;s essential to include jQuery within the view. Achieve this by adding the following line to the HTML header block:
&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... &lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; ... &lt;/head&gt; ... If you haven&rsquo;t included jQuery, you will encounter the following console warning in your browser: UI API won't be available because jQuery is not loaded.
You can find different versions of jQuery here.
Label # This represents a human-readable name for the view. You can utilize spaces, special characters, and a combination of upper and lower case letters.
This label will be displayed at the top of the grid view, so make sure you choose a label that users can easily understand.
Name # This serves as the internal name of the view. It should not contain special characters or spaces.
Commonly, you will employ the view&rsquo;s name in scripts and the REST API. Changing it could potentially impact your app, requiring manual adjustments.
Available REST API variables # The following variables are accessible in your custom view&rsquo;s scripts and are necessary for accessing your app&rsquo;s REST API:
sys.ws.TOKEN: Token required for making calls to the REST API. It needs to be included in the token header. sys.ws.API_URL: This is the URL used to access your app&rsquo;s REST API. It&rsquo;s typically something like https://&lt;app&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/api. Keep in mind that there might be a slight delay in setting these variables. If your JavaScript executes immediately after the view loads, these variables might initially be null.
In most scenarios, direct use of these variables won&rsquo;t be necessary, as you&rsquo;ll likely employ the provided utilities for interacting with the REST API.
REST API utils # These utilities are designed to facilitate seamless access to your app&rsquo;s REST API from scripts within the custom view. For additional information regarding the app&rsquo;s REST API, refer to this resource.

Samples # // execute an action for employees sys.ui.executeAction('employees', 'timeTrack', &quot;xxxxx&quot;, function(result) { console.info(&quot;&gt; success&quot;, result); }, function(result) { console.info(&quot;&gt; error&quot;, result); }, function(result) { console.info(&quot;&gt; canceled&quot;, result); }); // execute a global action sys.ui.executeAction('sampleEntity', 'globalAction', null, function(result) { console.info(&quot;&gt; success&quot;, result); }, function(result) { console.info(&quot;&gt; error&quot;, result); }, function(result) { console.info(&quot;&gt; canceled&quot;, result); }); Context API # Using these utilities, you gain access to the parameters sent by the service:
sys.ui.sendMessage({ name: 'navigate', view: 'customViewId', parameters: { ... } }) Within the custom view code, you have access to parameters through the following utilities: sys.context.PARAMS: This represents a key-value object map of parameters available in the custom view context. sys.context.getParam(paramName): This utility method allows you to retrieve the value of a specific parameter. Files # These files collectively constitute the custom view. They encompass HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
However, there is a particular file that is automatically generated: mainFile.html. This file is an HTML page and serves as the central point that loads when a user accesses the custom view. It cannot be deleted or renamed. You have the freedom to integrate any necessary HTML tags, CSS, or JavaScript code into this page, as well as include other files, as elaborated below.
The content of this page is displayed within an iframe within the main content area of your application. This design ensures that there are no conflicts with the remainder of the application.
Apart from the main file, you have the option to craft additional files to segment the custom view into more manageable sections, thus maintaining organization. These files can be JavaScript, CSS, or HTML files. Subsequently, you can integrate these files into the main custom view file. For instance, assume you possess the following files:
styles.css utils.js templates.html You can amalgamate them within the main file in this manner:
&lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; ... \${styles.css} \${utils.js} &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; ... \${templates.html} &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; CSS files will be encapsulated within a &lt;style&gt; tag, while JavaScript files will be enclosed within the &lt;script&gt; tag. Consequently, there&rsquo;s no need to include these tags within the files themselves. HTML contents are inserted exactly as they appear in the file.
Permissions # Permissions allow you to specify which groups have access to a particular view.
While permissions for a view can be managed directly within the view definition, it&rsquo;s essentially another approach to configuring permissions at the group level. This approach simplifies the process of setting permissions on the view for all existing groups.
For more comprehensive details on permissions, please consult the Groups documentation.
In a ReadOnly View # You have the option to designate a custom view as a readOnly CRUD action view within a Grid View. If chosen, a context containing pertinent information will be conveyed as JSON through a message event. This event can be monitored by adding an event listener within the main file of the custom view. Consequently, the custom view can access the provided information for display. Additionally, selecting the Refresh action button will trigger a message event to notify the custom view about the refresh action. This empowers the custom view to react to the event and execute necessary actions. This refresh event will also be triggered after executing other custom actions.
Sample of a listener in the custom view
// Logs the context and the event type window.addEventListener('message', function (event) { if(event.data.eventType){ var eventType = event.data.eventType; sys.logs.info(&quot;EVENT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(eventType)); }else if(event.data.context){ var context = event.data.context; sys.logs.info(&quot;CONTEXT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(context)); } }); As a create type view # You can designate a custom view as a create CRUD action view within a Grid View. If you choose a Custom View for this purpose, a context containing relevant information will be conveyed as JSON through a message event. You can monitor and respond to this event by adding an event listener in the main file of the custom view. Consequently, the custom view can access the provided information for display. Furthermore, selecting the Create action button will also trigger a message event to notify the custom view about the button press. This enables the custom view to react to the event and carry out necessary actions. This add event will also be triggered after executing other custom actions.
Sample of a listener set in a custom view in order to obtain some context information
window.addEventListener('message', function (event) { //We wait for a message from the platform to let us know the Create Button has been pressed if (event.data.eventType) { if (event.data.eventType === 'add') { //This is a method we should implement to save the new data and then comunicate it back to the platform self.createRecord(); } // Logs the context. This happened once the custom view is fully rendered }else if(event.data.context){ var context = event.data.context; var entity = event.data.context.entity; sys.logs.info(&quot;CONTEXT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(context)); } }); Once you&rsquo;re listening to the add event, it&rsquo;s time to implement the required functionality. Custom views provide a utility method for creating new records and subsequently notifying the platform. For further details, refer to the Custom View section.
Sample of an implementation of a createRecord() method
self.createRecord = function () { console.log('creating new record from REST API'); //Custom view method to create a record and inform back to the platform sys.ui.createRecord(entity.name, newRecord, function (recordCreated) { console.log(&quot;ON SUCCESS RECORD: &quot; + JSON.stringify(recordCreated)); }, function (error) { console.log(&quot;ON ERROR :&quot; + JSON.stringify(error)); }) }; As an Edit type view # You have the option to designate a custom view as an edit CRUD action view within a Grid View. If you choose a Custom View for this purpose, a context containing pertinent information will be conveyed as JSON through a message event. You can listen to and handle this event by adding an event listener within the main file of the custom view. Consequently, the custom view can access the provided information for display. Furthermore, selecting the Save action button will also trigger a message event to notify the custom view about the button press. This enables the custom view to respond to the event and execute necessary actions. This edit event will also be triggered after executing other custom actions.
Sample of a listener set in a custom view in order to obtain some context information
window.addEventListener('message', function (event) { //We wait for a message from the platform to let us know the Save Button has been pressed if (event.data.eventType) { if (event.data.eventType === 'edit') { //This is a method we should implement to save the new data and then comunicate it back to the platform self.updateRecord(); } // Logs the context. This happened once the custom view is fully rendered }else if(event.data.context){ var context = event.data.context; var entity = event.data.context.entity; var contextRecord = event.data.context.record; sys.logs.info(&quot;CONTEXT: &quot; + JSON.stringify(context)); } }); Once you&rsquo;re listening to the edit event, it&rsquo;s time to implement the required functionality. Custom views offer a utility method for updating records and subsequently notifying the platform. For further details, refer to the Custom View section.
Sample of an implementation of a updateRecord() method
self.createRecord = function () { console.log('creating new record from REST API'); //Custom view method to create a record and inform back to the platform sys.ui.createRecord(entity.name, newRecord, function (recordCreated) { console.log(&quot;ON SUCCESS RECORD: &quot; + JSON.stringify(recordCreated)); }, function (error) { console.log(&quot;ON ERROR :&quot; + JSON.stringify(error)); }) }; Resize container # To ensure that the custom view container doesn&rsquo;t exceed the size of the containing view and display incorrectly, you can adjust its size accordingly. This can be achieved by utilizing the sys.ui.resizeContainer method as outlined below.
Firstly, you need to assign an ID to the &lt;div&gt; element that encompasses all the HTML code. This ID will be used to determine the height of the custom view container. Here&rsquo;s an example:
&lt;body&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;allContent&quot; class=&quot;container-fluid&quot;&gt; Finally, the subsequent code should be added to the JavaScript file of the custom view. This code snippet is responsible for extracting the content of the HTML code to determine the appropriate height and then passing it as a parameter to the sys.ui.resizeContainer() method.
$(document).ready(function() { listenToHeightChanges(); }); const listenToHeightChanges = function() { const content = document.getElementById('allContent'); const resizeObserver = new ResizeObserver((entries) =&gt; { for (let entry of entries) { sys.ui.resizeContainer(entry.contentRect.height + 'px'); } }); resizeObserver.observe(content); }; Refresh custom view # sys.ui.refreshCustomView(): This method instructs the UI to initiate a refresh of the custom view. This functionality becomes valuable when any modification within the custom view impacts the actions that should be accessible in the header.

Description # This is a human-readable description that explains the purpose of the dashboard.
On event # This event is triggered after refreshing the dashboard. It receives information about where the refresh was initiated, whether it&rsquo;s from a user clicking the refresh button or via sending UI messages.
Parameters # Name Type Description event object This event object contains information about where the refresh was triggered. It can occur when a user clicks the refresh button in the UI or when UI messages are sent from the other side. Samples # // register external messages sys.logs.info(JSON.stringify(event)); if(event.sourceType == 'UI_MESSAGE') { // register action } Refresh using UI Message # You can refresh the dashboard view by sending UI messages. This action will refresh all its containers.
Example # In the following example, you can refresh the dashboard view called salesDashboard:
sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'view', name: 'refresh', views: ['salesDashboard'] }); If you want to refresh just one container, you can send the parameter widgetContainers as an array of container names to be updated.
sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'view', name: 'refresh', views: ['salesDashboard'], widgetContainers: ['sales', 'salesPerDepartment'] }); Layouts # Layouts are designed to contain widgets within rows and columns, following a grid system. You can build layouts of various shapes and sizes, utilizing a twelve-column system similar to Bootstrap.
A dashboard view contains a root layout in which you can add rows, and these rows serve as wrappers for columns or widgets. Columns, in turn, can wrap new rows or contain widgets. This hierarchical structure allows you to create a tree-like arrangement to organize your widgets effectively.
Each row and column has the following properties:
Label # This is a human-readable name for the node. You can use spaces, special characters, and a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters.
Name # This is the internal name of the view. It cannot contain special characters or spaces.
Widget # You can select one of the created widget views to be placed within the row or column.
Type # This indicates whether it is a column or a row.
Column size # For columns, users can select their size within the twelve-column system, similar to Bootstrap&rsquo;s grid system. Sizes can be designated as large, medium, or small, depending on the device size.
On event # This event is triggered after refreshing the specified widget. It receives information about where the refresh was initiated, which could be triggered by the user clicking the refresh button or sending UI messages.
Parameters # Name Type Description event object This event object contains information about where was the refresh fired, it can be when user click the refresh button of the UI or when send UI messages from other side. Samples # // register external messages sys.logs.info(JSON.stringify(event)); if(event.sourceType == 'UI_MESSAGE') { // register action } Refresh using UI Message # You can refresh each dashboard container by sending UI messages. The container will respond to this message and refresh its content using the default settings of its widget. Additionally, you can enhance this functionality by including additional information, such as filters, in the message. Please refer to the allowed UI message configurations in each type of widget for more details.
In the following example, you can see how to refresh the container named salesProgress within the dashboard named salesDashboard:
sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'view', name: 'refresh', views: ['salesDashboard'], widgetContainers: ['salesProgress'] }); Permissions # Permissions determine which groups can access this view.
While permissions for a view can be configured directly within the view definition, it mirrors the capabilities available in group configuration. The objective is to facilitate easy permission configuration for all existing groups.
Upon the creation of a new view, if a group holds permissions for the entity associated with that view, the view will inherently be granted permission for use by that group.
For a comprehensive understanding of permissions, refer to the Groups documentation.

UI messages # Widgets can respond to UI messages, such as data refresh or filter application.
Refresh and filter # You can send a message to refresh the widget with default settings. These messages are sent to the dashboard container and propagated to each widget.
Additionally, you can send a filter parameter to apply it to the query used for data retrieval. The query can be a query object or a query map. If using a query object, the filter is applied only when the entity matches that set in the widget. Refer to the Query Language for more information.
To apply filters, set the widgetContainer with a list of objects, each describing the container name and the filter to be applied to each widget. The title can also be sent to update the widget title.
Example # In this example, you can refresh and apply a filter by sending the filter parameter to a specified widget container.
var query = sys.data.createQuery('salesInfoPeriod'); query.field('department').equals('Department A'); sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'view', name: 'refresh', views: ['salesDashboard'], widgetContainers: [ { name: 'salesPerDepartment', filter: query } ] }); Example # Use case # A line chart is designed by connecting a series of data points with a solid line. Examples of data types suitable for representation in a line chart include annual sales rates and monthly rainfall. This type of chart allows trends in the data to be clearly observed over a continuous period.
Precondition # To set up information in a line chart, you need to have an entity. You can utilize a calculated entity to store aggregated information.
For instance, consider the entity salesInLastYear. It possesses a year-month field named period and an integer field named totalSales. This example assumes that the entity is calculated and is updated on a monthly basis.
Creating a Line Chart # The following steps illustrate how to create a line chart:
Step 1: Within the root layout of the designated dashboard, navigate to Assign Widget. Step 2: You can assign an existing widget or create a new one. In this scenario, we&rsquo;re creating a new widget. Step 3: Provide a label and name for the new widget. Select Line Chart as the widget type and choose subtype category. Additionally, specify the salesInLastYear entity mentioned in the preconditions. Save the changes to proceed to widget configurations. Step 4: In the Dataset configuration, arrange the sorting information. In this example, the sorting should be based on the period field. This is where you can also filter information from the salesInLastYear entity. Step 5: Configure the continuous variable for the Horizontal Axis. In our case, this would be the period field. You can customize display options for the selected field and opt to show or hide grid lines as needed. Refer to the documentation for further details. Step 6: Customize settings for the Vertical Axis Settings, allowing adjustments to the vertical axis appearance. More information can be found in the documentation. Step 7: Under the Series node, you can add fields (series) representing measurement information. For instance, you can add a new series using the button in the secondary menu. Step 8: In the Model Settings, add the field representing the measure. In our example, this would be the totalSales field. Step 9: For the added series, you have the ability to customize colors for lines and points. Additionally, advanced options are available for more nuanced customization. These steps guide you through the process of creating a line chart.

While a declarative approach is often preferred, we recognize that in certain situations, it may not be feasible to cover all scenarios. Sometimes, writing a few lines of code is more straightforward than navigating a complex and time-consuming user interface to express certain functionalities in a declarative manner.
The primary objective is for you to write scripts solely to define your application&rsquo;s behavior. You won&rsquo;t need to write boilerplate or infrastructure code. The platform handles these aspects, enabling you to focus on what truly matters: solving problems and delivering business value.
This document offers general insights into scripts, but you should consult the documentation to understand the various locations where scripts can be written and how they are employed in each scenario.
To simplify script writing, we&rsquo;ve developed a Javascript API that provides services for seamless access to your application&rsquo;s features and data. When writing scripts, you will extensively utilize this API. Make sure to have it accessible; however, you&rsquo;ll also find numerous links from the app builder leading to the documentation.
In addition to the Javascript API, you can also tap into endpoint features and custom libraries.
With the endpoints API, you can invoke functions within endpoints, sending messages to external services as though it were a straightforward method call. More information on using endpoints through scripts can be found here.
Custom libraries empower you to centralize reusable code. This code can be referenced throughout your app. For more details on custom libraries, refer to this link.
Permissions # When executing scripts, permissions are not rigorously enforced. For example, if a user has permissions to execute action A but lacks permissions to access entity E, yet the script within action A involves operations on entity E, this action will still proceed without issue when executed by the user.
This approach is rooted in the idea that developers are in command of scripts. If they grant permission to execute a script, the platform assumes the script&rsquo;s actions align with what the user is allowed to perform.
Exception handling # In case of an error, an exception will be raised. For instance, calling a method in the Javascript API with invalid parameters triggers an exception. Similarly, an exception will be thrown if there is an error executing an endpoint function.
If you do not catch the exception, it will propagate until it&rsquo;s captured by the platform, where it will be logged. You can then view the error in the app monitor. Here, you&rsquo;ll see the point where the exception occurred, a snippet of your code, and a stack trace to help trace the sequence of calls made.
There are instances where you might want to manage the exception to prevent script execution from halting. In such cases, you can employ standard Javascript tools to achieve this:
... try { app.endpoints.slack.sendMessage(params); } catch (e) { sys.logs.warn('There were errors sending message to Slack: '+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e), e); } The Javascript API provides several tools to assist in obtaining error messages and codes from exceptions. This is particularly beneficial because certain exceptions may have varying internal structures. These tools are available within the sys.exceptions package.
Also, remember that you can log exceptions even when using the INFO log level. This can prove to be valuable during the app debugging process. You can find this capability in the logging methods provided by the sys.logs package.
Throwing exceptions # If your code necessitates throwing exceptions, we strongly recommend using the throwException(code, message) method within the sys.exceptions package. When invoking this method, an exception will be thrown while retaining the stack trace.
Using the Javascript throw keyword and subsequently capturing it in your code will lead to the stack trace being lost. Consequently, you won&rsquo;t have visibility into the exact location of the problem.
For this reason, it is highly recommended to consistently use throwException(code, message) instead of just throw. As an example, rather than writing this code:
if (record.field('state').val() != 'new') { throw 'Task must be in state new'; } we recommend to write this code:
if (record.field('state').val() != 'new') { sys.exceptions.throwException('invalidState', 'Task must be in state new'); } Context # When scripts are executed, a context object will be available, offering information about the execution environment of your script. For instance, when working with a library, you might want to differentiate actions between different contexts or ensure that a listener is only executed under specific circumstances.
Comprehensive information about working with context can be found in the sys.context package.
It&rsquo;s crucial to comprehend the scope of the context. This scope initiates when an external event occurs, such as a REST API call or an endpoint event. The scope persists as long as we remain in the same thread. This implies that if a script triggers a background job, that job will execute in a separate scope, distinct from the original context.
For instance, consider an action that, when its script runs, saves a record. If this record belongs to an entity with a listener attached for record changes, and this listener is designated to execute in the background, the listener won&rsquo;t possess knowledge of the original action. This is because the background job runs in a distinct thread and lacks awareness of the action.
However, in the above scenario, if the listener isn&rsquo;t set to execute in the background, it can identify that it was triggered during the execution of the action. This is because it runs immediately in the same thread as the action.
Execution limitations # Scripts running outside of a background job (those executed as part of a REST API call) are subject to a maximum execution time of 30 seconds. Beyond this threshold, an exception will be thrown, halting the script.
For scripts with the potential for extended runtime, it&rsquo;s advisable to execute them in the background to prevent disruptions.

Allow refresh # This option determines whether the refresh button is displayed or hidden. This button facilitates the update of widget information. It&rsquo;s enabled by default.
Value calculation # Calculated # Define the method for calculating values. There are two approaches to value calculation:
Script: In this scenario, you can supply a script to perform the value calculation. The script operates within the following context:
Returns # string - you should return a string value as result
Samples # // displays a label based on the status of the contract var contract = sys.data.findOne('contracts', {number: '001'}); if (contract.field('status').val() === 'deployed') { return 'Active'; } return 'Inactive'; Aggregate: In this case, you can calculate a value based on an aggregate query involving other records. For instance, consider having an entity named departments and another named employees with a field named salary. To calculate the average salary for each department, you could add a field where the calculation involves aggregating data from the employees entity. This would be done for records with the department field pointing to the corresponding department record, and performing an average calculation on the salary field. This aggregation will be automatically updated whenever a salary changes or an employee is added or removed from the department. When the calculation is Aggregate, you can choose from the following options:
Aggregate entity: This refers to the entity containing the records that need to be aggregated. In the aforementioned example, it would be the employees entity. Expression: This expression defines the criteria that records in the Aggregate entity must meet to be included in the aggregation. In the above example, the expression was based on a field where the Current record was equal to the department field. This ensures that only employees from the current department are included in the aggregation. Aggregate operation: This operation specifies the calculation to be performed. It could be: Count: This counts the number of records matching the expression. Sum: This sums the values in the Aggregate field (see below) for the records matching the expression. Avg: This calculates the average of the values in the Aggregate field (see below) for the records matching the expression. Aggregate field: If the Aggregate operation is anything other than Count, a field must be selected for the operation to be applied. In the example above, the chosen field is salary. Content settings # Icon # Select an icon to be displayed in the indicator.
Color # Choose the indicator color for the icon and value. It should be a hexadecimal color code.
Permissions # Permissions determine which groups can access this view.
While permissions for a view can be configured directly within the view definition, it mirrors the capabilities available in group configuration. The objective is to facilitate easy permission configuration for all existing groups.
Upon the creation of a new view, if a group holds permissions for the entity associated with that view, the view will inherently be granted permission for use by that group.
For a comprehensive understanding of permissions, refer to the Groups documentation.

We need to remove the permission for deleting an event from the Admin users.
Remove deleting permissions for Admins # Let&rsquo;s proceed with the following steps:
👉 Click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Events &gt; Permissions.
👉 You should see a table with the permissions that the two default groups have on the entity &quot;Events&quot;.
👉 As you can see, only admins can delete events in our app. Maybe that&rsquo;s what you want, and it&rsquo;s a great way to manage it. However, now that we have our field &quot;Status&quot; we are going to utilize that. So, let&rsquo;s prevent Admin from deleting events.
👉 On the column &quot;Can delete&quot;, make sure that both groups are set to &quot;Never&quot;.
👉 Click on &quot;Save&quot;.
Great news!
With these small improvements, many potential problems in the future can be avoided. Let&rsquo;s proceed with pushing the changes to the app.
Impersonate an Admin # Once you have made the necessary changes, head over to the runtime tab and refresh the screen. You might be eager to verify if the modifications were implemented correctly.
Please be aware that you are currently logged in as a developer user, granting you extensive permissions, including the ability to delete events. Exercise caution.
To observe the changes, let&rsquo;s switch groups and emulate an Admin user.
👉 In the main header, click on the button with your name, a dropdown will be shown, click on &quot;Switch groups&quot;.
👉 A popup will appear, select only the Admin Group, and click on Switch.
👉 Now, go to All events and check that the option to delete an event is no longer available when you select an event. This should also be the case in the read-only view.

To comprehend the functioning of contexts, please refer to the &ldquo;Context&rdquo; section.
The root context represents the highest level in the call stack. For instance, if you execute an action through the REST API, and within that action&rsquo;s script a record is created, during the record creation, the current context would be the record&rsquo;s creation context. However, the root context in this scenario would be the execution of the action itself, as it&rsquo;s the operation that initiated the request.
The method is utilized as follows:
if (sys.context.root().entity('companies').create().check()) { // we are in the context of the creation of a record in the 'companies' entity ... } else { ... } So, the typical sequence begins with sys.context.root(), followed by a sequence of methods that define the context. At the end of this sequence, there&rsquo;s a call to check(), which assesses whether the context is the root context.
Here are the available methods for context checking:
sys.context.root().entity('entityName').create().check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').update().check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').delete().check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').import().check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').action('actionName').check() sys.context.root().listener('listenerName').check() sys.context.root().users().create().check() sys.context.root().users().update().check() sys.context.root().users().delete().check() sys.context.root().users().import().check() Certain contexts permit the addition of supplementary information to enhance precision regarding the executing context:
sys.context.root().entity('entityName').create().check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').update().with({recordId: id}).check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').delete().with({recordId: id}).check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').import().with({fileName: 'file.csv'}).check() sys.context.root().entity('entityName').action('actionName').with({recordId: id}).check() sys.context.root().users().create().with({email: 'email@test.com'}).check() sys.context.root().users().update().with({email: 'email@test.com'}).check() sys.context.root().users().update().with({id: '56cf0945ee42cf00064c105e'}).check() sys.context.root().users().delete().with({email: 'email@test.com'}).check() sys.context.root().users().delete().with({id: '56cf0945ee42cf00064c105e'}).check() sys.context.root().users().import().with({fileName: 'file.csv'}).check() Returns # object - An object that can be used to define the context to check; see description.
Samples # // checks that the script isn't running in the context of an import if (!sys.context.root().entity('companies').import().check()) { // do something here } any() # Returns an object that provides utilities for context evaluation across the call stack. To comprehend the functionality of contexts, please refer to the &ldquo;Context&rdquo; section.
This method is essentially identical to root(), but instead of solely checking the root context, the check() method will yield true if any context within the call stack matches. For instance, if you execute an action via the REST API, and within that action&rsquo;s script a record is created, during the record&rsquo;s creation, the current context would pertain to the record creation. By employing any() for context checking, as opposed to root(), assessing the context for both the action and the record creation would yield true:
sys.context.any().entity('companies').action('createAnotherRecord').check(); // returns true sys.context.any().entity('companies').create().check(); // returns true Please refer to the documentation of root() for more comprehensive information on defining a context and verifying it.
Returns # object - An object that can be utilized to define the context to be checked. Please see the description above for details.

If the record was already saved (it has an ID that exists in the entity), it will be updated.
This method will execute all validation rules defined in the entity and its fields. Additionally, it will verify the version of the record to ensure that no changes are overwritten. If the version doesn&rsquo;t match, an optimistic locking exception will be thrown.
Once the record is successfully saved, the following events will be triggered:
On record create: If the record is new and was created, this event is triggered. You can check the parameter options to modify this behavior. On record change: If the record already existed in the database, this event is triggered. You can check the parameter options to modify this behavior. Cascade updates: If the modification or creation of the record impacts other records, a background job will be created to update them. You can check the parameter options to modify this behavior. Parameters # Name Type Required Description record sys.data.Record yes The record to save into the database. Please note that this object will be updated with the saved version of the record. For instance, if an ID is not present, it will be set, and calculated fields will also be included. options object no This is a map containing options that can modify the behavior of the save operation, some of which can enhance import performance when dealing with a large number of records. These are the available options:
- calculateFields: When set to false, calculated fields won&rsquo;t be evaluated and will remain as null in the saved record. Default is true.
- performValidations: Indicates whether validations should be executed on the record before saving. Note that type validations are always performed. This option works in conjunction with validations defined in type rules. Default is true. - filterByReadWriteAccess: When set to false, the save process will disregard the read/write access options defined for the fields. This means that all fields will be saved into the database. Default is true.
- triggerEvents: If set to false, events such as &ldquo;on record create&rdquo; or &ldquo;on record change&rdquo; will not be triggered during the save operation. Default is true.
- defaultValues: When set to false, default values will not be set during the save operation. Default is true. - cascadeOperations: If set to false, cascade updates for relationship fields or aggregate fields won&rsquo;t be executed. Default is true.
- lockRecord: If set to false, the record won&rsquo;t have concurrency protection. This means that listeners or actions could be executed concurrently. Default is true.
To configure these settings as defaults, you can use the following parameter:
- mode: Possible values are &ldquo;standard&rdquo; and &ldquo;raw.&rdquo; &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; executes the operation using the default values for the parameters described above (this is the default mode). In cases where high performance is required and it&rsquo;s not critical to apply all metadata rules during the save operation, a special &ldquo;raw&rdquo; mode is available. In &ldquo;raw&rdquo; mode, the record is directly stored in the database without applying validations, permissions, read/write rules, default values, expression calculations, event triggering, cascading, or locking. No result is returned in &ldquo;raw&rdquo; mode. Returns # sys.data.Record - The saved or updated record. The ID will be set and calculated or default values will be there.
Exceptions # validationErrors
This exception is raised if record does not meet validation rules defined for the entity.
optimisticLocking
This exception is raised if record is an old version
badRequest
This exception is raised if record is invalid
notFound
This exception is raised if the record is being updated (it has an ID) and it is not found in the database.

Important!: The lock will be held for a maximum of 30 minutes, after which it will be automatically released.
Parameters # Name Type Required Default Description entityName string yes - The name of the entity. recordId string yes - The ID of the record to acquire the lock. timeout number yes 300000 (5 minutes) The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for the lock be acquired. If the lock cannot be acquired it returns a null. Returns # sys.data.Record - The updated version of the record when the lock was acquired.
Exceptions # badRequest
This exception is raised if recordId or timeout are invalid.
notFound
If record with ID recordId is not found in the database.
timeout
If the lock couldn’t be acquiered within the specified timeout.
Samples # // locks a record for 20 seconds try { var company = sys.data.lockById('companies', '57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8565'); log('company ['+company.label()+'] is locked'); try { // write some code here to update the company // if from the app you try to update the record it will be blocked // until the lock is released log('do something'); sys.utils.script.wait(20000); } finally { log('unlocking company ['+company.label()+']'); sys.data.unlock(company); } } catch(le) { sys.logs.error('Log could not have been acquired', le); } unlock(record) # This function releases a lock that was previously acquired.
If the lock was acquired multiple times, it needs to be released an equivalent number of times as well.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description record sys.data.Record yes The record object. Exceptions # badRequest
This exception is raised if record is invalid.
notFound
If record is not found in the database.
Samples # // locks a record for 20 seconds und unlocks it at the end var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name:'Blogpad'}); company = sys.data.lock(company); try { // write some code here to update the company // if from the app you try to update the record it will be blocked // until the lock is released log('do something'); sys.utils.script.wait(20000); } finally { sys.data.unlock(company); } unlockById(entityName, recordId) # This function releases a lock that was previously acquired.
If the lock was acquired multiple times, it needs to be released an equivalent number of times as well.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description entityName string yes The name of the entity. recordId string yes The ID of the record to unlock. Exceptions # badRequest
This exception is raised if record is invalid.
notFound
If record with ID: recordId is not found in the database.

For example, if you have two companies, each with contacts and orders, and you want to merge those two companies, this function allows you to change all relationship fields pointing to company1 to instead point to company2.
sys.data.replaceRefs(company1, company2); 🚨 Important!!! This change will be applied to all records in all entities, and there is no way to roll it back. Parameters # Name Type Required Description from sys.data.Record yes The record you want to replace its references. to sys.data.Record no The record you want to reference instead of from. This can be null and reference will be removed. Returns # string - The ID of the background job responsible for replacing references over all records. To monitor progress (including any errors), you should check the status of the background job.
Exceptions # badRequest
This exception is raised if from or to are invalid
notFound
If toId is provided and record with ID: toId is not found in the database.
Samples # // locks a record for 20 seconds und unlocks it at the end // create 2 companies var company1 = sys.data.createRecord('companies'); company1.field('name').val('testA'); sys.data.save(company1); var company2 = sys.data.createRecord('companies'); company2.field('name').val('testB'); sys.data.save(company2); // create 2 contacts associated to company1 var contact1 = sys.data.createRecord('contacts'); contact1.field('company').val(company1); contact1.field('firstName').val('contact1'); contact1.field('lastName').val('test'); contact1.field('email').val('contact1@test.com'); sys.data.save(contact1); var contact2 = sys.data.createRecord('contacts'); contact2.field('company').val(company1); contact2.field('firstName').val('contact2'); contact2.field('lastName').val('test'); contact2.field('email').val('contact2@test.com'); sys.data.save(contact2); // replace references from company1 to company2 var jobId = sys.data.replaceRefs(company1, company2); sys.jobs.waitForJob(jobId, 'FINISHED', 60*1000); // check if references were modified contact1 = sys.data.refresh(contact1); contact2 = sys.data.refresh(contact2); log(contact1.field('company').label()); log(contact2.field('company').label()); createQuery(entityName) # This function initializes and returns a sys.data.Query object. Please refer to the documentation for the Query language for more information.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description entityName string yes The name of the entity. Returns # sys.data.Query - The query builder object for the given entity.
Exceptions # badRequest
If entityName is not valid
Samples # // creates a query to find companies with type 'a' var query = sys.data.createQuery('companies'); query.field('type').equals('a'); log('total A companies: '+sys.data.count(query)); createAggregateQuery(entityName) # This function initializes and returns a sys.data.AggregateQuery object. Please refer to the documentation for the Query language for more information.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description entityName string yes The name of the entity. Returns # sys.data.AggregateQuery - The aggregate query builder object for the given entity.
Exceptions # badRequest
If entityName is not valid
Samples # // creates an aggregate query to find the contact with more skills per company var query = sys.data.createAggregateQuery('contacts'); query.sort().by('numberOfSkills', 'desc'); query.group() .by('company') .accumulate('firstName').first('firstName') .accumulate('lastName').first('lastName') .accumulate('skills').first('numberOfSkills'); var resultSet = sys.data.aggregate(query); while (resultSet.hasNext()) { log(JSON.stringify(resultSet.next())); } sys.data.Record # sys.data.Record represents a record of an entity. It contains methods to read and write fields, execute actions, and perform various other operations.
All operations that retrieve data will return objects of this type. For example, sys.data.findOne() or sys.data.findById() return objects of sys.data.Record.
You can also create Record objects using the method sys.data.createRecord():
var company = sys.data.createRecord('companies'); company.field('name').val('test company'); sys.data.save(company); id() # Returns the ID of the record. If this is a new record that hasn’t been saved into the database, this will return null.
Returns # string - The ID of the record.
Samples # // finds 10 companies and logs their ID var companies = sys.data.find('companies', {type: 'a', _size: 10}); while (companies) { var company = companies.next(); log('ID: '+company.id()); } label() # This function returns the label of the record based on the instance label expression defined in the entity. Please note the following:
The label is calculated when the record is saved into the database. New records that haven&rsquo;t been saved won&rsquo;t have a label. Records that were modified but not updated might have an outdated label. Returns # string - The label of the record.
Samples # // finds 10 companies and logs their label var companies = sys.data.find('companies', {type: 'a', _size: 10}); while (companies.hasNext()) { var company = companies.next(); log('Label: '+company.label()); } entityName() # Returns the name of the entity the record belongs to.
Returns # string - The name of the entity.
Samples # // prints the name of the entity var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {type: 'a'}); log('Entity name: '+company.entityName()); entityId() # Returns the ID of the entity the record belongs to.
Returns # string - The ID of the entity.
Samples # // prints the name of the entity var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {type: 'a'}); log('Entity name: '+company.entityId()); field(path) # This function returns a wrapper for the field at the specified path. Wrappers provide various methods for accessing data in different ways, and they are type-specific. This means that each data type will offer different methods. Please refer to the documentation of sys.data.Wrapper for more information.
It&rsquo;s important to note that this method doesn&rsquo;t return the actual value of the field. Instead, it returns an object of type sys.data.Wrapper, which you can use to read and manipulate the value. For example:
// 'company' is a record in entity 'companies' // get the name of the company var name = company.field('name').val(); // set the name of the company record.field('name').val('new name'); It is possible to access nested fields:
// 'contact' is a record in entity 'contacts' // get the state of contacts var state = company.field('address.state').val(); // set the state of the contact record.field('address.state').val('NY'); If fields are multi-valued you can access them using an index:
// 'company' is a record in entity 'companies' // get the first state for a company var state = company.field('addresses[0].state').val(); // the above line is the same as this one: var state = company.field('addresses').first().field('state').val(); // set a value in a multi-valued field company.field('addresses[1].state').val('CA'); If the index is out of bounds, no exception will be thrown. Instead, if you are trying to read the value, you will get null. If you are trying to set the value, a new element will be created.
When you attempt to access a multi-valued field, you will receive a sys.data.ManyWrapper object. This object provides several methods for accessing the items inside:
// 'company' is a record in entity 'companies' // gets the state of the first address company.field('addresses').first().field('state').val(); // gets the state of the last address company.field('addresses').last().field('state').val(); // iterates over all addresses company.field('addresses').each(function(address) { log('State: '+address.field('state').val()); }); Please check the documentation of sys.data.ManyWrapper for more information.
Finally, if the path is not a valid field, an exception will be thrown.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description path string yes The path of the field. It could be a nested or multi-valued field. Returns # sys.data.Wrapper | sys.data.ManyWrapper - A wrapper that you can use to read and manipulate the value.
Exceptions # badRequest
If path is invalid
Samples # // prints the name of 10 companies var companies = sys.data.find('companies', {_size: 10}); while (companies.next()) { var company = companies.next(); log('name: '+company.field('name').val()); } // creates a new company and sets the name var company = sys.data.createRecord('companies'); company.field('name').val('test company'); sys.data.save(company); parent() # This is particularly useful when you are working with records that have a prefix set. For example, let&rsquo;s consider an entity with the following structure:
name orderLines (multi-valued) product quantity notes (multi-valued) note date user calculatedField The calculatedField can have a script to calculate its value, and you will find the variable parentField in there. This variable represents a record object, but it has a prefix specific to that particular notes field, like orderLines[2].notes[1]. This prefix is important because you might need to know the path of your field, allowing you to write expressions like this one:
return parentField.parent().parent().field('name').val() + ' ' + parentField.parent().field('product').name() + ' ' + parentField.field('note').val(); Returns # sys.data.Record - The record object with a prefix set to the parent field
Samples # // this is the value expression for a calculated field taken the sample in the description return parentField.parent().parent().field('name').val() + ' ' + parentField.parent().field('product').name() + ' ' + parentField.field('note').val(); copy() # This method allows to get a copy of a record and save it as a new one. This is helpful when creating several similar records just changes a few fields
Returns # sys.data.Record - The record object without identifiers
Samples # // this is the copy of record with name changed and saved. var copy = record.copy(); copy.field('name').val('newOne'); sys.data.save(copy); isNew() # If the record has an ID set, this method will return false. Otherwise it will return true.
Returns # boolean - true if the record doesn’t have an ID, false otherwise.
Samples # // check if record is new before and after saving var company = sys.data.createRecord('companies'); company.field('name').val('test1'); log('new: '+company.isNew()); sys.data.save(company); log('new: '+company.isNew()); action(actionName, prams) # This function executes the specified action over the record. The record must be saved into the database before executing an action.
If the action has parameters, you can provide them as the second argument.
The response will vary based on the action&rsquo;s configuration. There are two possible responses:
Record: If the action doesn&rsquo;t return any custom response, this method will return the updated record.
Custom Action Response: If the action returns a custom response, then that response will be returned.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description actionName string yes The name of the action to execute. params object no If the action has parameters you should put them here. The format is the same used by the REST API. Returns # object - An object of type sys.data.Record or a custom response if the action has been configured to do that.
Samples # // executes the action 'logSomething' over a company var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name: 'Blogpad'}); company.action('logSomething'); log('completed!'); // executes the action 'logSomething' over a company with parameters var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name: 'Blogpad'}); company.action('logSomething', {param1: 'a', param2: 'b'}); log('completed!'); history() # This function returns an object of type sys.data.RecordHistoryLogs that allows you to query history logs. For more information on how to query a record&rsquo;s history logs, please refer to sys.data.RecordHistoryLogs.
Returns # sys.data.RecordHistoryLogs - An object of type sys.data.RecordHistoryLogs to query history logs
Samples # // prints who created the record var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name: 'Blogpad'}); log('creator: '+company.history().createLog().user()); toJson(options) # Converts the record to its native JSON representation.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description options object no These options allow you to control how the record will be converted. The available options are: - fields: By default, all fields will be fetched. If you want to specify which fields you want to fetch, you can pass this parameter. You can specify multiple fields by separating them with commas. System fields will always be returned (e.g., id, version, etc.). - relationshipsToFetch: A comma-separated list of relationship fields that will be fetched within the record. For example, if an entity has relationship fields named &lsquo;company&rsquo; and &lsquo;region&rsquo;, you can fetch those referenced records like this: relationshipsToFetch: &lsquo;company,region&rsquo;
- format: The format to use when fetching the fields. There are two options: &rsquo;native&rsquo; and &lsquo;plainText&rsquo;. The &rsquo;native&rsquo; option shows the raw value of each field, while &lsquo;plainText&rsquo; returns the values of the fields converted using the display option of each field. The default value is &rsquo;native&rsquo;.
- user: If the format is &lsquo;plainText&rsquo;, we may need the user context to convert values with the correct internationalization and timezones. The default is the current user. Returns # object - A key-value JSON structure with the fields of the record converted to their native representation.
Samples # // converts a contact to the JSON representation var record = sys.data.findOne('contacts', {email: 'gowensb1@google.ca'}); var recordJson = record.toJson({relatedFields: 'company'}); log('JSON version of record: ' + recordJson); fromJson(recordJson) # Parses a JSON representation of the record.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description recordJson object yes A key-value object map containing the proper record representation. A partial record representation is allowed. Samples # // copies contact info to a new person record using JSON representation var contact = sys.data.findOne('contacts', {email: 'gowensb1@google.ca'}); var contactJson = record.toJson(); var person = sys.data.createRecord('people'); person.fromJson(contactJson); log('Person after update: ' + person.toJson()); // performs a partial update of a contact var person = sys.data.findOne('people', {sid: '20309721919'}); var contact = sys.data.findOne('contacts', {email: 'gowensb1@google.ca'}); contact.fromJson({ phoneNumber: person.field('phoneNumber').val(), webSite: person.field('webSite').val() }); log('Contact after update: ' + contact.toJson({})); lock(callback) # This function is used to obtain a lock for the current record. It should be employed when multiple threads are vying for access to the same record, particularly in scenarios where listeners or actions might execute concurrently.
If the lock has already been acquired, this method will wait until it becomes available. However, if the lock cannot be acquired within the specified timeout, an exception will be thrown.
It&rsquo;s important to note that if you attempt to lock the same record within the same execution context, the lock will be granted immediately, adhering to the reentrant lock concept.
If you provide the callback parameter, the lock will be automatically released once the callback finishes executing. Furthermore, after the callback execution, if any modifications were made to the record within the callback, the record object will be automatically refreshed.
In cases where you don&rsquo;t specify the callback parameter, it is imperative to release the lock using the unlock() method. The best practice is to do this within a finally block to ensure it always occurs. Nevertheless, in the event that you forget to release the lock, the platform will automatically free the locks at the end of the script execution if they were not released before.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description callback function no This callback function is executed immediately after a successful lock acquisition. The acquired lock is automatically released upon the completion of the defined callback. Samples # // locks a record for 20 seconds und unlocks it at the end var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name:'Blogpad'}); company.lock(); try { // write some code here to update the company // if from the app you try to update the record it will be blocked // until the lock is released log('do something'); sys.utils.script.wait(20000); } finally { company.unlock(); } // locks a record for 20 seconds by specifying a callback var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name:'Blogpad'}); company.lock(function (record) { // write some code here to update the company // if from the app you try to update the record it will be blocked // until the lock is released log('do something'); sys.utils.script.wait(20000); // at the end lock will be released automatically }); unlock() # This function releases a lock that was previously acquired.
If the lock was acquired multiple times, it must also be released an equivalent number of times.
Samples # // locks a record for 20 seconds und unlocks it at the end var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name:'Blogpad'}); company.lock(); try { // write some code here to update the company // if from the app you try to update the record it will be blocked // until the lock is released log('do something'); sys.utils.script.wait(20000); } finally { company.unlock(); } sys.data.Wrapper # Whenever you need to access or manipulate the value of a field using the JavaScript API, you will interact with a wrapper. You should never create a wrapper manually. Instead, objects of this type are created by methods such as sys.data.Record.field()
The wrapper offers several utilities for retrieving and modifying the field&rsquo;s value. Depending on the field type, it may also provide different services. Please refer to the documentation for each field type to understand the specific utilities available in the wrapper.
val() # This method returns the value of the field. It&rsquo;s important to note that this value cannot differ from the value in the REST API. For example, a date-time field in the REST API is represented as a number, indicating milliseconds since the EPOCH. However, this method will return a Date object. Please consult the documentation for each field type to determine its default format.
Keep in mind that if the field you are referencing is multi-valued, this method will return an array of values.
Returns # any or any[] - Returns the value of the field. If it is multi-valued, it will return an array. Please consult the type&rsquo;s documentation to understand what is returned.
Samples # // get the value of different fields var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name:'Voonyx'}); var nameWrapper = company.field('name'); log('name: '+nameWrapper.val()); // you could also use a shorter form log('name: '+company.field('name').val()); // the wrapper for nested fields has utilities to access inner fields var firstAddressWrapper = company.field('addresses[0]'); var stateWrapper = firstAddressWrapper.field('state'); log('state: '+stateWrapper.val()); // or you could use the shorter form log('state: '+company.field('addresses[0]').field('state').val()); // or even shorter log('state: '+company.field('addresses[0].state').val()); // some fields, like data time, use a different format from the REST API // in this case the value is returned as a Date object var lastUpdateWrapper = company.field('lastUpdate'); log('last update: '+lastUpdateWrapper.val()); log('last update millis: '+lastUpdateWrapper.val().getTime()); // date time also supports formatting the date log('last update yyyy-MM-dd: '+company.field('lastUpdate').format('yyyy-MM-dd')); // if the field is multi-valued, you will get an array of values log('addresses: '+JSON.stringify(company.field('addresses').val())); // if the field isn't multi-valued, but you the parent is an you don't specify // an index, then the result will be an array as well log('states: '+JSON.stringify(company.field('addresses.state').val())); val(value) # This method sets the value of the field. You should refer to the type&rsquo;s documentation to determine the supported formats. For instance, a date-time field can accept Date objects or milliseconds from the EPOCH to facilitate operations.
If the field is multi-valued, you should provide an array of values. In such cases, it&rsquo;s advisable to consult the documentation for sys.data.ManyWrapper, which contains utilities for handling multi-valued fields.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description value any yes The value to set in the field. Type depends on the field. Exceptions # badRequest

Typically, a field is considered empty when its value is null. However, certain types may define additional rules; for example, text fields may consider an empty string as an empty value.
For multi-valued fields, this method returns true if the field has no values.
Returns # boolean - Returns true if the field is empty, otherwise false.
isNotEmpty() # This method returns true if the field is not empty. Usually, a field is not empty when it contains a valid value.

The benefit of utilizing this method over directly invoking sys.exceptions.ScriptException.code() is that you are relieved from the concern of whether the exception is a platform-specific one or belongs to another category. In scenarios where the exception type is not certain, it&rsquo;s advisable to first verify if it&rsquo;s a platform exception prior to retrieving the code.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description exception sys.exceptions.ScriptException or Error yes The platform exception to get the code from or any other kind of throwable object. Returns # string - The code of the exception or null.
Samples # // logs the code of a platform exception try { var query = sys.data.createQuery('entityThatDoesNotExist'); } catch (e) { log('error code: '+sys.exceptions.getCode(e)); } // when it is a Javascript exception it will return 'null' try { // this var doesn't exist an will throw a Javascript error var a = doesNotExist * 5; } catch (e) { log('error code: '+sys.exceptions.getCode(e)); } getMessage(exception) # This method retrieves the error message from the given exception. If the parameter is a string, the method returns that string. If the parameter is of type sys.exceptions.ScriptException, it returns the contained message. In the case of an object, the method provides its JSON representation. If none of these cases apply, the parameter is attempted to be cast to a string.
The key advantage of utilizing this method, as opposed to directly invoking sys.exceptions.ScriptException.message(), is that you need not be concerned about whether the exception is a platform-specific one or belongs to another category. When the exception type is uncertain, it&rsquo;s advisable to first confirm whether it&rsquo;s a platform exception before retrieving the message.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description exception sys.exceptions.ScriptException or Error yes The platform exception to get the message from or any other kind of throwable object. Returns # string|object - The message of the exception, a JSON object or just the string representation.
Samples # // logs the message of a platform exception try { var query = sys.data.createQuery('entityThatDoesNotExist'); } catch (e) { log('error message: '+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)); } // logs the message of a Javascript exception try { // this var doesn't exist an will throw a Javascript error var a = doesNotExist * 5; } catch (e) { log('error message: '+sys.exceptions.getMessage(e)); } getAdditionalInfo(exception) # This method returns an object containing supplementary information about the error, if such information is available. It&rsquo;s important to note that this feature is not accessible across all exceptions, but rather applies to a select few. For instance, certain endpoint exceptions might include details about the specific request that encountered failure.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description exception sys.exceptions.ScriptException or Error yes The platform exception from which to extract additional information. While you can pass other throwable objects, please note that in such cases, there will be no additional information available, and the method will simply return an empty object. Returns # string|object - An object containing the additional information. This object will be empty if there is no additional information available.
Samples # // logs the message of a platform exception try { app.endpoints.http.post(params); } catch (e) { log('error additional info: '+sys.exceptions.getAdditionalInfo(e)); } throwException(code,message) # Throws an exception with the specified code and message. The primary advantage of using this method, as opposed to the standard JavaScript throw keyword, is that if the thrown exception is caught and logged, the stack trace will be accessible. Unlike the typical throw keyword, which does not offer the stack trace in cases where logging the exception is necessary.
It is recommended to consistently use this method over the throw keyword.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description code string yes A code that identifies the exception. Any appropriate code can be used. message string yes The error message. If displayed to users, consider internationalizing this message. Samples # // throws an exception if the state is not 'new' if (record.field('state').val() != 'new') { sys.exceptions.throwException('invalidState', 'Task must be in state new'); } sys.exceptions.ScriptException # This type of object is thrown when errors occur within the platform or when dealing with known errors in scripts (such as validation scripts).

Create the app from scratch # Once you are logged into the developer portal, you should see the Home Page:
Click on the New App button in the Your Apps section. Fill in the app label and name. Please note that the name must be unique on the platform. Select Slingr Free as the plan for your app. Choose the option to start from scratch. Wait until the app is created. This process usually takes a minute to complete. Discover the application components # Once your app is successfully created, you will see its details. By default, you will be the owner of the app, and you will have developer permissions for the development environment, which is created by default. In the environment details, you will be able to navigate through the different components of the app.
👉 Go To App: This button will take you to your running app. Right now, it doesn&rsquo;t provide much functionality as the app is empty.
👉 Monitor: From here, we can see the app&rsquo;s status, background jobs, logs, etc. If you need to know what&rsquo;s going on, this is the place to look.
👉 Builder: This is where we will develop our app.
You can also see the different environments and components on the Apps Page.
The first button represents the Runtime, the second is the Monitor, and the third one is the Builder. As our new app is empty, the first thing we need to do is to go to the app builder by clicking on the Builder button (the one with the wrench). That will automatically open the builder in a new tab.
Let&rsquo;s wrap up this section here. If you want to learn more, let&rsquo;s proceed to the next section: First steps with the builder.

When working with UI messages, there are several important considerations:
Script Association: While you can call this method from any script, it is recommended to use it primarily in scripts associated with views, such as event scripts in views. This ensures clarity regarding when these scripts will be executed.
Non-View Scripts: If you call this method from a script that is not associated with a view (e.g., an action script), the message may not be sent to the UI and could be lost. This can occur when the action is executed in the background or as part of a non-UI-related process, such as an external REST API call.
Message Order: You can send multiple messages to the UI, and they will be executed in order. However, it is essential to understand that some messages might override or discard others. For instance, if you reload the page, any message after that command will be lost.
Message Timing: Messages may not be sent to the UI immediately. The timing of UI messages is implementation-specific and depends on the available features in the UI. UI messages might be executed only after the associated request has been completed.
All messages have at least two fields:
scope: Indicates the message&rsquo;s scope and which elements in the UI should process it. Currently, there are four scopes: global, view, plugin, and action.

To describe the logic of a flow, you are required to perform a drag-and-drop action of steps and connect them together. In essence, a Flow is a sequence of predefined and configurable steps that can be employed to execute a wide array of business rules in various parts of an application.
Flow settings # The table below outlines the general properties of flows:
Label Type Description Label string This is a human-readable name of the flow. You can use spaces, special characters, and mix upper case and lower case letters. Name string This is the internal name of the flow. It cannot contain special characters or spaces. Description string This is the description of the flow. Debug boolean If enabled, it will print the generated code in logs. General rules # The following list outlines the rules that must be adhered to in all flows:
The flow name must be unique within the app. Each step name must be unique within the flow. Both start and end steps are mandatory. The start step should be unique. Inputs must adhere to their own validation rules. Outputs must adhere to their own validation rules. Steps, with the exception of the context step and expanded versions of subflows, must have at least one connection. Every step, except for start and end steps, should serve as the source or target of at least one connection. Item selection from the context should align with its scope. Considerations # This section provides essential considerations to keep in mind when working with flows:
Currently, input values can only consist of fixed values or references to variables available in the context. Condition expressions are expressed as scripts. Quick start # The flow editor comprises available steps, which can be dragged and interconnected to construct the flow.
Each step serves a distinct function and may include input parameters, generating output data that becomes part of the flow&rsquo;s context for reuse by other steps.
Steps are interconnected by drawing connections from the green rectangle of the source step to the destination step. Some steps feature a red square, indicating the flow to follow in case of an error during step execution.
In the example above, the flow initiates with the start step, followed by the find data step searching for all companies. For each of the companies discovered in the previous step, the update record step is executed, and the corresponding log step is triggered, whether the operation succeeds or not. The flow concludes with the end step.

Navigate to the Builder section of your app. Look for a property that supports flows as an alternative. After selecting this option, an &ldquo;Open editor&rdquo; button should appear. The flow designer consists of three main panels: the step&rsquo;s palette, the canvas, and the properties panel.
The step&rsquo;s palette # The step&rsquo;s palette is located on the left side of the flow designer and contains all the available steps categorized for building a flow. To start creating a flow, simply drag a step from the palette and drop it onto the canvas. At the top of the panel, there is a search box that allows you to find steps by name.
✅ You can collapse this panel using the &lt;&lt; icon located at its top side to maximize the size of the canvas. ✅ Hovering over a step will give you a short description of what it does The canvas # The canvas is the central and primary panel of the flow designer. It&rsquo;s a grid area where your flow, comprising steps and connections, takes shape. To add a step to the canvas, drag it from the palette and drop it onto the canvas. Once added, the step initializes, and its source or target connection&rsquo;s endpoints appear on its sides. Double-clicking a step expands the right panel to show its properties.
You can rearrange steps within the canvas by dragging and dropping them. Connections between steps are maintained when you move them. The flow designer supports multi-selection of steps for convenience. To select multiple steps, hold the shift key and drag a selection area with your mouse. To deselect, press Escape or click an empty canvas area.
To delete a step, click it once to reveal a delete button in the top-right corner. Clicking this button removes the step from the canvas along with its associated connections.
The context stack # In the top right corner of the canvas, you&rsquo;ll find the context stack. This special step cannot be deleted or connected, but you can reposition it. The context stack displays the values and variables available for use in the different steps of the flow. Learn more about this feature.
The properties panel # The properties panel is on the right side of the flow designer. It provides information related to the entire flow and individual steps. This information is displayed with editable forms for easy configuration.
Clicking the Settings button in the header displays general information about the flow, including its name, label, and description.
When you click on a step within the canvas, the properties panel displays settings specific to that step. The upper section includes basic properties like name, label, and description. The lower section allows you to configure inputs and outputs for that step. For more information on inputs and outputs, refer to the relevant section in the documentation. Feel free to use this improved and structured text in your documentation.
&#x26A0;&#xFE0F; After editing any text input field inside the properties&rsquo; panel, you should press the tab key on your keyboard to save those changes when navigating between tabs or steps. Please note that this action does not automatically save the changes upon closing the designer. To save your changes permanently, you need to click the Save or Apply button in the header. ✅ You can collapse this panel using the &gt;&gt; icon located at its top side to maximize the size of the canvas. Additionally, pressing the Escape key will also collapse the panel. ✅ If the properties&rsquo; panel is collapsed, you can double click on any step within the canvas to expand the properties panel and view the step properties. The header # At the top of the flow designer, you&rsquo;ll find the header of the view in which you&rsquo;ve opened it. This header is the same as that of the particular view, but you might notice that some buttons change when the flow designer is open. Here are the buttons displayed in the header when the flow designer is open:
Close: Closes the flow designer. If changes were made without saving, a warning prompt will appear before closing it. Reset: Reverts the flow and context stack to the state before the last save. Settings: Opens the properties panel and displays the general settings for the flow (such as name, label, and description). ℹ️ Activating the Debug switcher will display information about the flow and how it is transformed into a JavaScript function in the monitor component. Full Screen: Toggles fullscreen mode on and off. Apply: Saves all changes made to the flow while keeping the flow designer open.

The connection&rsquo;s endpoints are the small colored squares located at the edges of the steps. They become visible once they are dragged onto the canvas. Different steps have different connection endpoints, leading to various types of connections.
Connection types # There are three types of connections that can be established:
Regular connections: Represented by green arrows, these connections define the execution order of the different instructions represented by each step.
Error connections: Indicated by red arrows, error connections come into play when a certain step fails. In such cases, the next step in the flow execution will be the one connected to this error connector.
Else connections: Marked with purple arrows, else connections are only available in conditional steps. If the condition set in this step is not met, the next step in the flow execution will be the one connected to this else connector.
Connection endpoint types # There are four types of connection endpoints:
Green connection endpoints: Located on the right or sometimes the bottom side of all steps (except for the &ldquo;end&rdquo; step). Dragging a connection from one of these endpoints and dropping it onto a target step will establish a normal connection. Red connection endpoints: Positioned on the bottom side of certain steps. Creating a connection from one of these endpoints and connecting it to a target step will create an error connection. Else connection endpoints: Found on the bottom side of Condition type steps. Connecting a connection from one of these endpoints to a target step will establish an else connection. Target connection endpoints: Situated on the left side of group container steps. To establish a connection, drop it onto one of these endpoints. The connection can be regular, error, or else, depending on the source connection endpoint. ℹ️ Connection targets, such as regular steps or target connection&rsquo;s endpoints, will display a dashed outline border when a connection is being dragged on top of them.

Creating the &ldquo;Tasks&rdquo; Entity # The tasks entity serves as the central component in the task manager application. It allows users to create, store, and manage task records efficiently. Through this entity, users can access various views of their tasks, granting them the flexibility to organize and handle records according to their preferences and needs.`,content:`Hi, welcome to the builder!

Creating the &ldquo;Tasks&rdquo; Entity # The tasks entity serves as the central component in the task manager application. It allows users to create, store, and manage task records efficiently. Through this entity, users can access various views of their tasks, granting them the flexibility to organize and handle records according to their preferences and needs.
Now we will create the tasks entity and then some actions and views to display the records.
Let&rsquo;s go!
👉 Right-click on the node Model &gt; Entities, and a dropdown menu will be shown.
👉 Click on New Entity.
👉 Fill in the form with the following details:
Label: Tasks Name: tasks Type: Data 👉 Let’s add a simple field. Fill the label with Title, the name with title, the type should be text, and the multiplicity should be one. Click on Add.
👉 Finally, let’s set the record label. The record label is calculated for every record, and it is something that will identify your record. It doesn’t need to be unique but should be human-friendly. Leave the option as Field, and in the dropdown, select Title.
👉 The form should look something like this. If so, click on Create.
Create some adittional fields # Great! Now that we have finished creating the entity, let’s add some more fields:
👉 Right-click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Fields, and click New Field.
For every field, you will need to complete the form with some basic information: label, name, type, and multiplicity. Create the following fields with these settings:
Label Name Type Required Default value Notes Number number Auto increment - - This a number that will be incremented for every new task created. Title title Text Yes - The title of the task. Status status Choice Yes To Do This is the status of the task. Possible values will be To do, In progress, Done and Archived Description description HTML No - A longer description of the task. Depending on the type, you might see some additional options at creation time, which is the case for the Status field where you will need to add the four possible statuses: To do, In progress, Done, and Archived. It should look something like this:
Clicking on Save and edit will create the field and will open the details view for that field, where you will be able to change other settings, like the default value and required flag. You can also open it by clicking the field node in the tree. In our sample app, we need to take care of the following things for these fields:
👉 Title: the setting Required should be set to Always.
👉 Status: the setting Required should be set to Always. Also, in the Default value, you should choose Value and then select the value To Do from the dropdown.
Remember to save all the changes. In the end, your structure should look similar to this one:
Create a simple grid view # Now that we have created the fields for the entity, the next step is to create a view so we can see something in our app. For that, we will create a simple grid view that will allow you to list, create, edit, and delete tasks. To create the grid view, follow these steps:
👉 Right-click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Views, and a dropdown menu will be shown.
👉 Click on New View &gt; Grid View.
👉 Fill in the form with the following details:
Label: All tasks Name: allTasks Columns: Number, Title, Status. 👉 Click on Create.
Once we have the view, we need to indicate how to navigate to it. Let’s add it to what’s going to be the sidebar of our app. Click the node User interface &gt; Navigation &gt; Main menu, and follow these steps:
👉 Click on Add new menu entry on the top-right of the page, and then click on the option Add view entry.
👉 In the view, select the view All Tasks, and complete the label with All Tasks. You can add an icon if you want.
👉 Click on Create.
Push your changes # Great! We have a basic app already configured.
Let’s see how it looks at runtime, but first, we need to push the changes so the runtime has the latest version of our app.
👉 On the header of the builder, click the button next to your name (The hamburger button).
👉 A dropdown menu will be shown. Click on &quot;Push Changes.&quot;
👉 A popup will appear, displaying the changes you have made. Review them, and if everything looks good, click on &quot;Push Changes.&quot;
Once the process is done, the changes will be reflected in the runtime. To open the runtime, go back to the developer portal, in the Apps page, click the runtime button (The first one). That will automatically open the runtime in a new tab.
🎉
Fantastic!

Once dropped onto the canvas, you will notice that these steps are wider and taller than regular steps. They also display a &ldquo;Dropped steps here&rdquo; message in the center.
You can drag and drop other steps from the palette as well as the canvas into a group container step. Once a step is dropped into a group container, it becomes a part of that group, and a linked icon will appear on both the parent and child steps. This creates a sub-context, and the flow execution will proceed with the steps inside the group container before moving on to the next step connected to the group container. This means that you can place multiple steps inside a container and connect them with each other. The first step to be executed within a group container will be the one that has not been the target of any connection. Therefore, it&rsquo;s important to ensure that only one step inside a group container is not the target of a connection.

They are used in a flow to create code in a more graphical way, eliminating the need to learn any specific coding language. Instead, you simply need to drag and drop steps from the steps palette onto the canvas area and then connect them by dragging a connector from a source step to a target step. Steps are categorized, and documentation for each step can be found on the following pages.
Categories # System # The first category of steps is labeled &ldquo;System&rdquo;. Here, you&rsquo;ll discover steps that aid in constructing your flow. For instance, you&rsquo;ll find the logger step, which logs information to your application&rsquo;s monitor, and the set var step, which creates a new variable in the context. The steps in this category include: start, end, logger, script, and set var. Documentation for each of these steps can be found on the following pages.
Control # The second category, &ldquo;Control&rdquo;, contains steps that allow you to work with structures commonly used in programming languages and more. The steps in this category include: For Each, If, Subflow, Try-Catch, and While. You can find the documentation for each of these steps on the following pages.
Data # The third category, &ldquo;Data&rdquo;, includes steps related to the data stored in your application. Here, you&rsquo;ll find useful steps for searching, creating, deleting, updating records, and more. The steps in this category comprise: Create record, Delete Data, Delete Record, Execute Action on data, Execute Action on record, Execute Global Action, Fin Data, Find Record, Find Record by id, Save Record, and Update Record. You can access the documentation for each of these steps on the following pages.
User Interface # The final category, &ldquo;User Interface&rdquo;, provides steps for controlling the functionality of your application&rsquo;s user interface. The steps in this category include: Download File, Go Back, Go To View, Open Action, Open External Link, Reload, Show Message, Start Task, and Update task. Detailed documentation for each of these steps can be found on the following pages.

To create a step, it&rsquo;s necessary to specify inputs, outputs, and the script that the step will execute. Once configured, this library becomes a reusable asset that can be conveniently utilized in various parts of your application.
Inputs # Inputs are versatile and optionally configurable. Each input can be customized extensively, from defining its data type to establishing general rules. This empowers users to employ expressions and scripts to tailor the behavior of the library step within the Flow Editor.
In the Flow Editor, we have the libraries divided by the configured categories Outputs # Outputs are also optional and each output has its Type.
Advantages # Why Use Step Libraries?
Reusability # Step Libraries offer a powerful mechanism for code reuse. You write a step once, and it becomes available for use in any flow within your application. This eliminates redundant effort and promotes efficiency.
Custom Business Logic # Not all business logic fits neatly into standard pre-defined steps. Step Libraries empower you to tackle complex scenarios by allowing you to insert custom JavaScript code. This flexibility ensures that you can handle a wide range of situations according to your specific needs.
Facilitating Collaboration # Step Libraries can facilitate new dynamics between citizen developers and traditional developers. When an entity used within a Step Library is updated, the library may need manual updates to accommodate changes. This collaborative approach ensures that both citizen developers and traditional developers can work together effectively to maintain and enhance the functionality of your application.
Refactoring # When you make changes to a Step Library, it&rsquo;s crucial for developers to be aware of the potential impacts due to the following rules:
Code Modifications # If the code within a Step Library is altered, all Flows utilizing this step will automatically adopt the new behavior. Therefore, any changes to the code will propagate across relevant Flows.
Input Modifications # Modifying the inputs of a Step Library will inevitably result in changes to how the Step is used within your flows. It&rsquo;s important to note that altering Step library inputs will necessitate updates in all the places where this Step is used.
Entity Updates # When an entity utilized within a Step Library undergoes changes or updates, the Step Library will require manual adjustments to accommodate these modifications. This ensures that the Step Library remains synchronized with the evolving entity.
Example # Step Library Definition: To begin, we define our Business Logic step. In this example, it accepts a list as input and returns a list after applying a specific process to each element. Enhancing Workflow: Following the definition of the Business Logic step, we navigate to the Flow Editor and realize that we need to process multiple lists. To simplify this operation, we decide to add a Library Step that streamlines the concatenation of these lists. Ready for Use: With the new Step Library in place, we return to the Flow Editor, where the newly defined steps are now readily available for use. Data Collection: In our sample scenario, we gather the data to be processed using Set Var steps. Once all the data lists are collected, the Concat List step effectively merges these values, preparing them for processing by the Business Logic Step. `}),e.add({id:133,href:"/slingrDoc/getting-started/getting/first-steps/task-mananger/adding/",title:"Adding actions to an entity",description:`In this section, we will be working with the actions of an entity.

Let's go back to the builder and get to work. We already have the basic operations to create, edit, and delete tasks. However, it would be better to have a custom workflow that enforces some rules. For example, a task can only be moved to &quot;In progress&quot; if it is in the status &quot;To do&quot;. To create the workflow, we will:
✅ Create actions to move the task through the different statuses. ✅ Do not allow modification of the status manually. ✅ Add a column to the grid view. Create the action &ldquo;Start work&rdquo; # 👉 Right-click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Actions, a dropdown menu will be shown, click &quot;New Action&quot;.
👉 Fill in the form with:
Label: Start work Name: startWork. 👉 In the Preconditions section, you will indicate under which conditions the action can be executed. For the &quot;startWork&quot; action, the precondition is that the field &quot;Status&quot; must be &quot;To do&quot;. This can be indicated with an expression. Select the option &quot;Expression&quot; for Preconditions, then set up the following expression by clicking on &quot;Add new rule&quot; and configure it like this:
👉 In the field &quot;Action script&quot;, add the following script to the body of the function:
record.lock(function(record) { record.field('status').val('inProgress'); sys.data.save(record); }); Create some more actions # Now it&rsquo;s your turn!
In the following table, you will find the settings for the actions required to handle different task statuses. Please repeat the instructions from the previous step to create each action.
Label Name Precondition Action script Complete complete Status equals to In progress record.lock(function(record) { record.field('status').val('done'); sys.data.save(record); }); Archive archive Status NOT equals toArchived record.lock(function(record) { record.field('status').val('archived'); sys.data.save(record); }); Stop work stopWork Status equals to In progress record.lock(function(record) { record.field('status').val('toDo'); sys.data.save(record); }); Reopen reopen Status equals to Done or Archived record.lock(function(record) { record.field('status').val('toDo'); sys.data.save(record); }); Limit write access to status field # Good, now we have all the actions to manage the workflow! However, there is one problem: anyone can simply change the status field by editing the task. This is not what we want; instead, we want people to follow the actions workflow we have defined. To achieve this, we need to make the Status field read-only:
Click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Fields &gt; Status. Select the Display options tab. For the option Read only select Always. Save changes by clicking on Apply. To keep it simple, we just made the field read-only. However, the correct way to do it is to remove permissions to change that field, which will be enforced at the API level and not just the UI. We will see that later. Adding a column to the grid view # Finally, we will add a column to the grid view that shows the actions available for that record:
Click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Views &gt; All tasks. Inside List settings, set the option &quot;Record menu&quot; to &quot;All&quot; and set the flag &quot;Display record menu column&quot; to &quot;active&quot;. Save changes by clicking on &quot;Apply&quot;. Awesome! Go ahead and push the changes. To do that, you need to click the icon next to your username (The hamburger icon). A drop-down menu will be shown, then click &quot;Push changes&quot;.

If you encounter any issues, refer back to the previous section to see if there is something you might have missed.
That’s it for this section. In the next one, we will create a new type of view that complements our current implementation. For more information, proceed to the next section: &ldquo;Creating a workflow view.&rdquo;

However, you might desire a different design for a specific use case. Let&rsquo;s consider adding a workflow view to make our app look even more impressive. To provide you with a visual representation of what I mean, here&rsquo;s an example of how it would look:
Create the workflow view # Isn&rsquo;t it awesome? Let&rsquo;s create the workflow view:
Right-click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Views and select New view &gt; Workflow view from the dropdown menu.
Fill in the form with:
Label: Task Board Name: taskBoard Click on Create and edit. Add some card configuration details # Once the workflow view is created, its configuration details will appear. The first thing to do is to set up the card settings:
In the Header setting, select Script and add the following code in the function&rsquo;s body: return 'Task #' + record.field('number').val(); In the Summary setting, leave Field selected, and in the Summary field select Title.
Click on Apply to save changes.
Create a rank field # Before defining the columns, we need to add a new field to the entity that will be necessary to enable ranking of records:
Right-click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Fields and select New Field.
Fill in the form with:
Label: Rank Name: rank Type: Rank Click on Create and edit.
Go to the Display options tab.
Set the option Visible to Never. This is to hide this field as we don’t want to show it to our users. We will only use it internally to keep the rank of tasks.
Click on Save to save changes.
Create the view columns # Now we are ready to create the columns in the workflow view
Click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Views &gt; Task board &gt; Columns.
Click on the Create button on the top-right of the page.
Fill in the form with:
Label: To do Filters: Status equals To do Set the flag Allow to rank records and select the field Rank in Rank field.
Click on Create to save the column.
Repeat the same process to create these two additional columns:
Label Filters In progress Status equals to In progress Done Status equals to Done Define transitions # Once you have the columns we need to define the transitions that will allow moving a card from one column to another:
Click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Views &gt; Task board &gt; Transitions.
Click on the Create button on the top-right of the page.
Fill in the form with:
Label: Start work Source column: To do Target column: In progress Action: Start work (tasksStartWork) Click on Create to save the transition. Repeat the same process to create these other transitions:
Label Source column Target column Action Complete In progress Done Complete (tasksComplete) Stop work In progress To do Stop work (tasksStopWork) Reopen from done Done To do Reopen (tasksReopen) General improvements to the view # We are almost there! Let&rsquo;s do a few improvements:
Click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Views &gt; Task board &gt; CRUD actions &gt; Tasks.
For Create, Read and Update set the flag Open in modal to active and click on Apply. This will allow the opening of tasks in a modal.
Click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Views &gt; Task board.
Inside Cards settings, in the setting Record menu select Some.
Then in Available actions click on Add and select the action Archive (tasksArchive). This is to be able to archive tasks because we didn’t create a column for the Archived status to keep this view clean.
Add the view on the interface navigation # Click on the node User interface &gt; Navigation &gt; Main menu.
Click on the Add new menu entry button on the top-right of the page and select Add view entry.
Fill in the form with:
View: Task board Label: Task board Icon: select the one you like the most! Click on Create to save the menu entry. 🥳
Great! We are done. I know this section was difficult so thanks for sticking with it.
Now let&rsquo;s just push the changes and open the runtime tab.
In the next section, we are going to see the changes we have made.

Additionally, you can log error results using a &ldquo;try-catch&rdquo; step or create a record using data derived from action parameters.
Context stack # Adding items to the context stack # Certain steps have the capability to output their results into the execution context of Flows. For example, the &ldquo;createRecord&rdquo; step can output the created record, which can then be included in the context stack by selecting &ldquo;put in context.&rdquo; Depending on where the Flow is executed from, the context stack may also include default items. For instance, if the Flow is executed from an action, the action&rsquo;s parameters become accessible in the context stack.
Utilizing context items in inputs # By default, an input is designed to accept a static value. However, some inputs are equipped to accept values from the context. In such cases, you can choose a value from the context based on its scope.
Scope # Each item within the context stack operates within its designated scope. Context items are exclusively available when editing a step that follows the step responsible for outputting the context item. For instance, you cannot select context items from steps located outside the execution flow of the step that produces the context. Similarly, you cannot choose an output from a step that precedes the step responsible for generating the context.
Example # In the &quot;updateRecord&quot; step, nested within a &quot;tryCatch&quot; step, it&rsquo;s not possible to access the output of &quot;findData&quot; because it is not within the execution flow of &quot;findData.&quot; However, it can access the output of the parent step: &quot;tryCatchError.&quot;

Review the actions # To execute actions, click the button located at the top-right corner of the card. In this case, only the &quot;Archive&quot; action is available as per our configuration. You should also be able to perform other actions by moving the card through different columns.
Create tasks through modal view # To create new tasks, click on the &quot;Create&quot; button, and a pop-up will appear.
Verify transitions # You can move the cards between different columns. Keep in mind that only the movements we have configured will be allowed. For example, in our app, moving a card from the &quot;To do&quot; column to the &quot;Done&quot; column should not be possible.
Verify ranking feature # Lastly, you can rank tasks by moving them up and down.

For example, a simple query to retrieve 10 active companies using the REST API looks like this:
GET https://app.{{ site.slingr_domain }}/prod/runtime/api/data/companies?state=active&amp;_size=10 In contrast, with the Javascript API, it would look something like this:
var records = sys.data.find('companies', {state: 'active', _size: 10}); while (records.hasNext()) { // do something } In the Javascript API, you can also utilize the query builder), which provides helpful tools for constructing queries:
var query = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field('state').equals('active') .size(10); var records = sys.data.find(query); while (records.hasNext()) { // do something } Generally, when dealing with more intricate query criteria, the query builder is easier to use than the simple map form because it offers conversion and parsing features. Additionally, there are queries that cannot be expressed using the query map version. For instance:
var query = sys.data.createQuery('companies').query(function(q) { return q.or( q.field('name').like('test'), q.field('name').equals('abc') ); }); The above query cannot be expressed using the query map version because you cannot use the same key in the map. It would look like this:
var query = { name: 'like(test)', name: 'like(abc)' }; In this case, the key name appears twice in the map and won&rsquo;t work as expected.
Another consideration is exception handling. When using the query builder, exceptions may be thrown during query construction. For example:
try { var query = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field('doesNotExist').equals('test'); log('count: '+sys.data.count(query); } catch (e) { log('error: '+e.message()); } The script above will throw an exception when calling the field() method because the field doesNotExist is not a valid field in the companies entity. Similar exceptions will occur with other improper query configurations, so be aware that exceptions may arise during query construction.
On the other hand, when using the query map, exceptions won&rsquo;t occur during query construction but rather when executing the query:
try { var query = {doesNotExist: 'test'}; var count = sys.data.count('companies', query); log('count: '+count); } catch (e) { log('error: '+e.message()); } In this case, the exception will be thrown when calling the sys.data.count() method.
This documentation section provides samples in all three versions for comparison. If a feature only applies to specific versions, it will be explicitly indicated.

JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // var records_05 = sys.data.find('companies', {name: &#39;Blogpad&#39;}); log('total: '+records_05.count()); while (records_05.hasNext()) { log(records_05.next().label()); } // var query_05 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;name&#39;).equals(&#39;Blogpad&#39;) var records_05 = sys.data.find(query_05); log('total: '+records_05.count()); while (records_05.hasNext()) { log(records_05.next().label()); } // GET /data/contacts?name=Blogpad You can also provide several values (comma-separated), and it will act like an OR:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // var records_06 = sys.data.find('companies', {name: &#39;Blogpad,Jazzy&#39;}); log('total: '+records_06.count()); while (records_06.hasNext()) { log(records_06.next().label()); } // var query_06 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;name&#39;).equals(&#39;Blogpad,Jazzy&#39;) var records_06 = sys.data.find(query_06); log('total: '+records_06.count()); while (records_06.hasNext()) { log(records_06.next().label()); } // GET /data/contacts?name=Blogpad,Jazzy If the value you are matching already contains a comma, you should wrap it in double quotes:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // var records_07 = sys.data.find('companies', {name: &#39;&#34;ACME, Inc&#34;&#39;}); log('total: '+records_07.count()); while (records_07.hasNext()) { log(records_07.next().label()); } // var query_07 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;name&#39;).equals(&#39;&#34;ACME, Inc&#34;&#39;) var records_07 = sys.data.find(query_07); log('total: '+records_07.count()); while (records_07.hasNext()) { log(records_07.next().label()); } // GET /data/contacts?name=&#34;ACME, Inc&#34; You can filter by nested fields as well:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // var records_08 = sys.data.find('companies', {&#39;contactInformation.email&#39;: &#39;dwelchdp@apple.com&#39;}); log('total: '+records_08.count()); while (records_08.hasNext()) { log(records_08.next().label()); } // var query_08 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;contactInformation.email&#39;).equals(&#39;dwelchdp@apple.com&#39;) var records_08 = sys.data.find(query_08); log('total: '+records_08.count()); while (records_08.hasNext()) { log(records_08.next().label()); } // GET /data/contacts?contactInformation.email=dwelchdp@apple.com If the nested group field is multi-valued, you can still perform a query like this:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // var records_09 = sys.data.find('companies', &#39;{&#39;_or&#39;: {&#39;type&#39;: &#39;a&#39;, &#39;_and&#39;: {&#39;type&#39;: &#39;b&#39;, &#39;isCustomer&#39;: true}}}&#39;); log('total: '+records_09.count()); while (records_09.hasNext()) { log(records_09.next().label()); } // var query_09 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') &#39;.query(function(q) { return q.or(q.field(&#39;type&#39;).equals(&#39;a&#39;), q.and(q.field(&#39;type&#39;).equals(&#39;b&#39;), q.field(&#39;isCustomer&#39;).equals(true))); })&#39; var records_09 = sys.data.find(query_09); log('total: '+records_09.count()); while (records_09.hasNext()) { log(records_09.next().label()); } // GET /data/contacts?_query=or(filter(&#39;type&#39;,&#39;a&#39;),and(filter(&#39;type&#39;,&#39;b&#39;),filter(&#39;isCustomer&#39;,&#39;true&#39;))) Available operators for filtering:
equals(value) notEquals(value) like(value) // options: /value, value/ or /regexp/ between(from,to) greater(value) greaterOrEquals(value) less(value) lessOrEquals(value) empty() notEmpty() Each field type supports different operators. Refer to the documentation for each type to see which operators are supported.
The following operators are available for all types:
equals(value) notEquals(value) empty() notEmpty() If you don't specify any operator, the default one is equals(). It's a good practice to consult the documentation for each type when filtering by field values, as each type may support different querying methods and alternative formats for simplifying usage. Complex queries # Complex queries are similar to regular queries, but they allow you to mix and nest OR and AND expressions. They are separated because they require a different syntax, especially in the REST API and query builder.
Here&rsquo;s a sample complex query, highlighting the differences between the three versions:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // Query on companies var records_10 = sys.data.find('companies', { _or: { type: &#39;a&#39;, _and: { type: &#39;b&#39;, isCustomer: true }}}); log('total: '+records_10.count()); while (records_10.hasNext()) { log(records_10.next().label()); } // Query on companies var query_10 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;type&#39;).equals(&#39;a&#39;).or().field(&#39;type&#39;).equals(&#39;b&#39;).field(&#39;isCustomer&#39;).equals(true) var records_10 = sys.data.find(query_10); log('total: '+records_10.count()); while (records_10.hasNext()) { log(records_10.next().label()); } // Query on companies GET /data/contacts?_query=or(filter(&#39;type&#39;,&#39;a&#39;),and(filter(&#39;type&#39;,&#39;b&#39;),filter(&#39;isCustomer&#39;,&#39;true&#39;))) The query map version is almost the same as simple queries; it uses the _or and _and operators. However, in the REST API and query builder, due to interface limitations, complex queries must be written differently.
For the REST API, you must pass a _query parameter, where you can use these operators:
or(...): evaluates to true if any of the criteria passed as arguments is true. It accepts a list of filter criteria that can be and(), filter(), or another or(). and(...): similar to or(), but it evaluates to true if all the criteria passed as arguments are true. filter(field,value): a simple field filter, like those in simple queries. Always enclose the name and value with single quotes. When using the query builder, you should use the query() method, which accepts a function as a parameter. This function receives a helper object and should return a query criteria. Here are some examples of complex queries in the REST API and query builder:
JS Query BuilderREST API // Query on companies var query_11 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .and(q.field(&#39;isCustomer&#39;).equals(true), q.or(q.field(&#39;addresses.state&#39;).equals(&#39;CA&#39;), q.field(&#39;numberOfEmployees&#39;).greater(100))) var records_11 = sys.data.find(query_11); log('total: '+records_11.count()); while (records_11.hasNext()) { log(records_11.next().label()); } // Query on companies GET /data/contacts?_query=and(filter(&#39;isCustomer&#39;,&#39;true&#39;),or(filter(&#39;addresses.state&#39;,&#39;CA&#39;),filter(&#39;numberOfEmployees&#39;,&#39;greater(100)&#39;))) JS Query BuilderREST API // Query on companies var query_12 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .or(q.field(&#39;isCustomer&#39;).equals(true), q.field(&#39;numberOfEmployees&#39;).greater(900), q.field(&#39;addresses.state&#39;).equals(&#39;CA,CO,NJ&#39;)) var records_12 = sys.data.find(query_12); log('total: '+records_12.count()); while (records_12.hasNext()) { log(records_12.next().label()); } // Query on companies GET /data/contacts?_query=or(filter(&#39;isCustomer&#39;,&#39;true&#39;),filter(&#39;numberOfEmployees&#39;,&#39;greater(900)&#39;),filter(&#39;addresses.state&#39;,&#39;CA,CO,NJ&#39;)) Query parameters # In addition to field filtering, you can specify query parameters to control how the query is executed.
Limit size # You can set a maximum number of records to fetch using the _size parameter or the size() method:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // fetches 10 records at most var records_13 = sys.data.find('companies', {_size: 10}); log('total: '+records_13.count()); while (records_13.hasNext()) { log(records_13.next().label()); } // fetches 10 records at most var query_13 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .size(10) var records_13 = sys.data.find(query_13); log('total: '+records_13.count()); while (records_13.hasNext()) { log(records_13.next().label()); } // fetches 10 records at most GET /data/contacts?_size=10 It&rsquo;s possible that the query returns fewer records than the specified number.
The REST and Javascript APIs will return the total number of records matched by the query. Please refer to the documentation for each API for more information.
For the REST API, the maximum value you can specify is 1,000, with a default value of 20 if not specified. These limits and defaults do not apply to the Javascript API, as it uses a cursor to iterate over the results. Skip records # You can provide an offset to skip some records in your query. You can use a number to indicate how many records to skip, or you can use an ID.
If you use a number, that number will indicate how many records to skip. Use the _offset parameter or the offset() method:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // skips the first 5 records and the first record retrieved will be the 6th one var records_14 = sys.data.find('companies', {_offset: 5}); log('total: '+records_14.count()); while (records_14.hasNext()) { log(records_14.next().label()); } // skips the first 5 records and the first record retrieved will be the 6th one var query_14 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .offset(5) var records_14 = sys.data.find(query_14); log('total: '+records_14.count()); while (records_14.hasNext()) { log(records_14.next().label()); } // skips the first 5 records and the first record retrieved will be the 6th one GET /data/contacts?_offset=5 If there are fewer records than the specified offset, the query will return no results.
The other option for specifying an offset is an ID. This form can only be used if you are either explicitly sorting by the id field or if you have omitted sorting options in your query (the default is id).
For instance, if you query 5 records and receive the following record IDs:
[ '57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8665', '57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8565', '57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8547', '57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c84b1', '57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349' ] To fetch the next 5 records, you should make the following query, using the last record&rsquo;s ID as the offset:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // starts after record with ID 57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349 var records_15 = sys.data.find('companies', {_offset: &#39;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349&#39;}); log('total: '+records_15.count()); while (records_15.hasNext()) { log(records_15.next().label()); } // starts after record with ID 57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349 var query_15 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .offset(&#39;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349&#39;) var records_15 = sys.data.find(query_15); log('total: '+records_15.count()); while (records_15.hasNext()) { log(records_15.next().label()); } // starts after record with ID 57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349 GET /data/contacts?_offset=57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349 This query will not return the record with ID 57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349 but rather the next 5 records after it.
If you need to iterate over all records using the REST API and want to avoid fetching the same record twice, it's advisable to use IDs as offsets. Using numbers might result in duplicated or missed records due to modifications of records affecting your query. Sorting # You can sort results based on a field. By default, the id field and desc direction are used if no sorting options are specified. However, you can change this behavior using the _sortField and _sortType parameters or the sortBy() method:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // var records_16 = sys.data.find('companies', { state: &#39;active&#39;, _sortField: &#39;name&#39;, _sortType: &#39;asc&#39; }); log('total: '+records_16.count()); while (records_16.hasNext()) { log(records_16.next().label()); } // var query_16 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;state&#39;).equals(&#39;active&#39;).sortBy(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;asc&#39;) var records_16 = sys.data.find(query_16); log('total: '+records_16.count()); while (records_16.hasNext()) { log(records_16.next().label()); } // GET /data/contacts?state=active&amp;_sortField=name&amp;_sortType=asc You can even use a nested field for sorting:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // var records_17 = sys.data.find('companies', { _sortField: &#39;contactInformation.email&#39;, _sortType: &#39;asc&#39; }); log('total: '+records_17.count()); while (records_17.hasNext()) { log(records_17.next().label()); } // var query_17 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .sortBy(&#39;contactInformation.email&#39;, &#39;asc&#39;) var records_17 = sys.data.find(query_17); log('total: '+records_17.count()); while (records_17.hasNext()) { log(records_17.next().label()); } // GET /data/contacts?_sortField=contactInformation.email&amp;_sortType=asc The _sortField parameter specifies the field to sort by, and _sortType specifies the sorting order, which can be one of the following:
asc (ascending) desc (descending) Keep in mind that you cannot use multi-valued or nested fields as the sorting field.
So far you cannot specify many fields for sorting. In some cases you can achieve the same result by adding a calculated field that concatenates the fields you want to use for sorting.
Include fields # By default, all fields are returned in the results. If you only want to retrieve specific fields, you can use the _fields parameter or the includeFields() method:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // only name and email fields will be fetched var records_18 = sys.data.find('companies', { _fields: &#39;name,email&#39; }); log('total: '+records_18.count()); while (records_18.hasNext()) { log(records_18.next().label()); } // only name and email fields will be fetched var query_18 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .includeFields(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;email&#39;) var records_18 = sys.data.find(query_18); log('total: '+records_18.count()); while (records_18.hasNext()) { log(records_18.next().label()); } // only name and email fields will be fetched GET /data/contacts?_fields=name,email You can select nested fields like addresses.state. If you put the parent field, like addresses, all inner fields will be included.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // you can also indicate nested fields var records_19 = sys.data.find('companies', { _fields: &#39;name,addresses.state&#39; }); log('total: '+records_19.count()); while (records_19.hasNext()) { log(records_19.next().label()); } // you can also indicate nested fields var query_19 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .includeFields(&#39;name&#39;, &#39;addresses.state&#39;) var records_19 = sys.data.find(query_19); log('total: '+records_19.count()); while (records_19.hasNext()) { log(records_19.next().label()); } // you can also indicate nested fields GET /data/contacts?_fields=name,addresses.state System field will always be returned (id, version, label).
Fetch related records # This parameter only functions with the REST API; it will not have any effect when used with the Javascript API. If you wish to reduce the number of requests to the server, you can retrieve a record and its related records by using the _relationshipsToFetch parameter. This parameter accepts a comma-separated list of relationship fields.
REST API // Fetches the primary records along with company information GET /data/contacts?_relationshipsToFetch=company&amp;_size=10 REST API // You can specify multiple relationship fields separated by commas, even if the relationship field is multi-valued GET /data/contacts?_relationshipsToFetch=company,skills&amp;_size=10 Global search # This is only allowed for entities with global search enabled. When querying using the global search feature, it will attempt to match the provided string in any field within the entity, rather than targeting a specific field. For example:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // Finds records where any field contains &#39;lacinia&#39; or &#39;erat&#39; var records_22 = sys.data.find('companies', { _globalSearch: &#39;lacinia erat&#39; }); log('total: '+records_22.count()); while (records_22.hasNext()) { log(records_22.next().label()); } // Finds records where any field contains &#39;lacinia&#39; or &#39;erat&#39; var query_22 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .globalSearch(&#39;lacinia erat&#39;) var records_22 = sys.data.find(query_22); log('total: '+records_22.count()); while (records_22.hasNext()) { log(records_22.next().label()); } // Finds records where any field contains &#39;lacinia&#39; or &#39;erat&#39; GET /data/contacts?_globalSearch=lacinia erat Note that to match the entire phrase, you should enclose it with double quotes:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds record where any field has the tense &#39;lacinia erat&#39; var records_23 = sys.data.find('companies', { _globalSearch: &#39;&#34;lacinia erat&#34;&#39; }); log('total: '+records_23.count()); while (records_23.hasNext()) { log(records_23.next().label()); } // finds record where any field has the tense &#39;lacinia erat&#39; var query_23 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .globalSearch(&#39;&#34;lacinia erat&#34;&#39;) var records_23 = sys.data.find(query_23); log('total: '+records_23.count()); while (records_23.hasNext()) { log(records_23.next().label()); } // finds record where any field has the tense &#39;lacinia erat&#39; GET /data/contacts?_globalSearch=&#34;lacinia erat&#34; Please be aware that all searches are case-insensitive.
Format # This parameter only works with the REST API; it will not have any effect when used with the Javascript API. In the REST API, you can utilize the _format parameter to specify the format of the returned records. There are two options:
native: Returns the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; values for each field. For example, a date-time field will be returned as milliseconds. This is the default format. plainText: Returns field values converted to strings using the display options of each field. For example, a date-time field will be returned as a string based on the field&rsquo;s display options. The plainText format is useful when you need to display information to users in an external application outside of the Slingr runtime, and you do not want to handle formatting.
REST API // Companies query sample GET /data/contacts?_format=plainText&amp;_size=10 Format using one specific user&rsquo;s settings # This can be achieved using the _formatForUser parameter and is only meaningful when using the plainText option in _format.
You should provide either the user&rsquo;s ID or email that will be used to format the record. For instance, if the user has configured a different time zone, date-time fields will use that setting to format dates. This is useful when you need to send emails to individuals residing in different time zones.

This feature is implemented using the MongoDB&rsquo;s aggregation framework, so you&rsquo;ll notice many similarities. This guide provides all the information you need to write aggregate queries, and you shouldn&rsquo;t need to refer to MongoDB&rsquo;s documentation.
In essence, there is a pipeline where the input consists of records in the entity, and you apply various operations to filter, sort, and aggregate the data. Here&rsquo;s an example of an aggregate query in JavaScript:
var resultSet = sys.data.aggregate('contacts', [ {match: {'company.isCustomer': true}}, {group: {by: 'company', totalSkills: 'sum(numberOfSkills)'}} ]); while (resultSet.hasNext()) { var result = resultSet.next(); // the format of the result is a simple object you can stringify log(JSON.stringify(result)); } In this pipeline, we have two steps:
Select only records associated with a customer. Group by company and sum the field numberOfSkills, storing it in the field totalSkills. The input of one step is the result of the previous one, which is why it&rsquo;s called a pipeline. The result set for the above example will contain records with the following structure:
{ &quot;company&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c530d&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Flashset&quot; }, &quot;totalSkills&quot;: 12 } As you can see, you get a simple JavaScript object (it follows the JSON representation you can see in the REST API object) instead of something like a record object. This is because the structure changes based on the operations in your pipeline, and the result is no longer a record from an entity. You should check each type&rsquo;s documentation to verify the format used in the JSON representation.
Aggregated queries, like other queries, can be expressed using a query map, a query builder, and the REST API. Below, you&rsquo;ll find samples for all versions.
Operations # Count # The Count operation allows you to count elements and store the result in a field. This field cannot contain special characters; only numbers and letters are allowed, and it will be the only field in the result.
Here are some samples of how you can use it:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // Counts companies from New York var records_01 = sys.data.find('companies', {match: {&#39;address.state&#39;: &#39;NY&#39;}, count: &#39;counter_field&#39;}); log('total: '+records_01.count()); while (records_01.hasNext()) { log(records_01.next().label()); } // Counts companies from New York var query_01 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') query.match().field(&#39;address.state&#39;).equals(&#39;NY&#39;); query.count().counterName(&#39;counter_field&#39;); var records_01 = sys.data.find(query_01); log('total: '+records_01.count()); while (records_01.hasNext()) { log(records_01.next().label()); } // Counts companies from New York GET /data/contacts?{&#34;match&#34;: {&#34;address.state&#34;: &#34;NY&#34;}, &#34;count&#34;: &#34;counter_field&#34;} When you run the above query, you will get output similar to this:
{&quot;counter_field&quot;:2} Skip # The Skip operation allows you to skip a specified number of elements. This operator is configured with a positive integer, which determines how many results to omit from the beginning.
Here are some samples of how you can use it:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // Retrieves contacts while skipping the first 3 results var records_02 = sys.data.find('contacts', {skip: 3}); log('total: '+records_02.count()); while (records_02.hasNext()) { log(records_02.next().label()); } // Retrieves contacts while skipping the first 3 results var query_02 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.skip().step(3); var records_02 = sys.data.find(query_02); log('total: '+records_02.count()); while (records_02.hasNext()) { log(records_02.next().label()); } // Retrieves contacts while skipping the first 3 results GET /data/contacts?{&#34;skip&#34;: 3} Limit # The Limit operation allows you to limit the number of elements in your aggregation results. This operator is configured with a positive integer and retrieves the specified number of results.
Here are some samples of how you can use it:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // retrieves first 5 contacts var records_03 = sys.data.find('contacts', {limit: 5}); log('total: '+records_03.count()); while (records_03.hasNext()) { log(records_03.next().label()); } // retrieves first 5 contacts var query_03 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.limit().step(5); var records_03 = sys.data.find(query_03); log('total: '+records_03.count()); while (records_03.hasNext()) { log(records_03.next().label()); } // retrieves first 5 contacts GET /data/contacts?{&#34;limit&#34;: 5} Unwind # The Unwind operation allows you to unwind multi-valued fields. This operator is configured with a field; if this field is an array, it will retrieve the same record with a single value for the selected field for each element in the array.
Here are some samples of how you can use it:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // retrieves companies unwinding services var records_04 = sys.data.find('companies', {unwind: {fieldPath: &#39;services&#39;, includeEmpty: true}}); log('total: '+records_04.count()); while (records_04.hasNext()) { log(records_04.next().label()); } // retrieves companies unwinding services var query_04 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') query.unwind().path(&#39;services&#39;).includeEmpty(true); var records_04 = sys.data.find(query_04); log('total: '+records_04.count()); while (records_04.hasNext()) { log(records_04.next().label()); } // retrieves companies unwinding services GET /data/contacts?{&#34;unwind&#34;: {&#34;fieldPath&#34;: &#34;services&#34;, &#34;includeEmpty&#34;: true}} When you run the above query, you will get output similar to this:
{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Photolist&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:&quot;SERVICE_A&quot;} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Photolist&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:&quot;SERVICE_C&quot;} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d62e4b0ce322b0c6268&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;DabZ&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:&quot;SERVICE_A&quot;} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d62e4b0ce322b0c6268&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;DabZ&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:&quot;SERVICE_B&quot;} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d62e4b0ce322b0c6268&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;DabZ&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:&quot;SERVICE_D&quot;} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d60e4b0ce322b0c50f0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mydo&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:null} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c7d12&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Zazio&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:&quot;SERVICE_C&quot;} ... Lookup # The Lookup operation allows you to lookup elements from other entities in current records. This operator is equivalent to a SQL left-join using the name of a foreign entity, a foreign field in that entity, and a local field in the current entity (set in the query).
Here are some samples of how you can use it:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // retrieves companies with related contacts var records_05 = sys.data.find('companies', {&#39;lookup&#39;: {&#39;localFieldPath&#39;: &#39;id&#39;, &#39;foreignFieldPath&#39;: &#39;company.id&#39;, &#39;foreignEntityName&#39;: &#39;contacts&#39;, &#39;as&#39;: &#39;relatedContacts&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_05.count()); while (records_05.hasNext()) { log(records_05.next().label()); } // retrieves companies with related contacts var query_05 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') query.lookup().localField(&#39;id&#39;).foreignField(&#39;company.id&#39;).foreignEntity(&#39;contacts&#39;).as(&#39;relatedContacts&#39;); var records_05 = sys.data.find(query_05); log('total: '+records_05.count()); while (records_05.hasNext()) { log(records_05.next().label()); } // retrieves companies with related contacts GET /data/contacts?{&#34;lookup&#34;: {&#34;localFieldPath&#34;: &#34;id&#34;, &#34;foreignFieldPath&#34;: &#34;company.id&#34;, &#34;foreignEntityName&#34;: &#34;contacts&#34;, &#34;as&#34;: &#34;relatedContacts&#34;}} When you run the above query, you will get output like this:
{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Photolist&quot;, &quot;relatedContacts&quot;:[ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5506fc44c2eee3b1a702694c&quot;, &quot;company&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5506fc43c2eee3b1a7026944&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Photolist&quot; }, &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Doe&quot;, &quot;email&quot;: &quot;john.doe@abcinc.com&quot;, &quot;phoneNumbers&quot;: [ &quot;3039514211&quot;, &quot;3039514210&quot; ] }, { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5506fc44c2eee3b1a702694d&quot;, &quot;company&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5506fc43c2eee3b1a7026944&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Photolist&quot; }, &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;Martin&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Smith&quot;, &quot;email&quot;: &quot;martin.smith@abcinc.com&quot; }] } {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d62e4b0ce322b0c6268&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;DabZ&quot;,&quot;relatedContacts&quot;:[ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5506fc44c2eee3b1a702694e&quot;, &quot;company&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5506fc43c2eee3b1a7026946&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;DabZ&quot; }, &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;William&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Brown&quot;, &quot;email&quot;: &quot;william.brown@acme.com&quot;, &quot;phoneNumbers&quot;: [ &quot;3039514211&quot;, &quot;3039514210&quot; ]}] } {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d60e4b0ce322b0c50f0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mydo&quot;,&quot;relatedContacts&quot;:[]} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c7d12&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Zazio&quot;,&quot;relatedContacts&quot;:[]} ... Match # The Match operation allows you to filter records in the pipeline. You need to use this operation to select the records you want to use for your aggregation.
This filter works the same way as the ones for regular queries, which means you can pass a query map or query builder (if you are using the JavaScript API). Keep in mind that only filters by fields are supported here while other parameters are ignored.
Here are some samples of matching operations:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // Counts the number of skills for contacts of customers // see how the match operator filters contacts where company is a customer var records_06 = sys.data.find('contacts', {match: {&#39;company.isCustomer&#39;: true}}, {group: {totalNumberOfSkills: &#39;sum(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_06.count()); while (records_06.hasNext()) { log(records_06.next().label()); } // Counts the number of skills for contacts of customers // see how the match operator filters contacts where company is a customer var query_06 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.match().field(&#39;company.isCustomer&#39;).equals(true); query.group().accumulate(&#39;totalNumberOfSkills&#39;).sum(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_06 = sys.data.find(query_06); log('total: '+records_06.count()); while (records_06.hasNext()) { log(records_06.next().label()); } // Counts the number of skills for contacts of customers // see how the match operator filters contacts where company is a customer GET /data/contacts?{&#34;match&#34;: {&#34;company.isCustomer&#34;: true}}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;totalNumberOfSkills&#34;: &#34;sum(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // counts the number of skills for contacts // the match operator filters contacts by customers and state equals to New Jersey var records_07 = sys.data.find('contacts', {match: {&#39;company.isCustomer&#39;: true, &#39;address.state&#39;: &#39;NJ&#39;}}, {group: {totalNumberOfSkills: &#39;sum(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_07.count()); while (records_07.hasNext()) { log(records_07.next().label()); } // counts the number of skills for contacts // the match operator filters contacts by customers and state equals to New Jersey var query_07 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.match().field(&#39;company.isCustomer&#39;).equals(true).field(&#39;address.state&#39;).equals(&#39;NJ&#39;); query.group().accumulate(&#39;totalNumberOfSkills&#39;).sum(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_07 = sys.data.find(query_07); log('total: '+records_07.count()); while (records_07.hasNext()) { log(records_07.next().label()); } // counts the number of skills for contacts // the match operator filters contacts by customers and state equals to New Jersey GET /data/contacts?{&#34;match&#34;: {&#34;company.isCustomer&#34;: true, &#34;address.state&#34;: &#34;NJ&#34;}}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;totalNumberOfSkills&#34;: &#34;sum(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} Sort # Allows to change the sorting of records in your aggregation pipeline. This is useful for sorting the final result or to use together with accumulators like first() or last() in the group operator.
Here are some samples of how you can use it:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds the contact with more skills per company var records_08 = sys.data.find('contacts', {sort: {&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;: &#39;desc&#39;}}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, firstName: &#39;first(firstName)&#39;, lastName: &#39;first(lastName)&#39;, skills: &#39;first(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_08.count()); while (records_08.hasNext()) { log(records_08.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company var query_08 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.sort().by(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;, &#39;desc&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;firstName&#39;).first(&#39;firstName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;lastName&#39;).first(&#39;lastName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;skills&#39;).first(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_08 = sys.data.find(query_08); log('total: '+records_08.count()); while (records_08.hasNext()) { log(records_08.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company GET /data/contacts?{&#34;sort&#34;: {&#34;numberOfSkills&#34;: &#34;desc&#34;}}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;firstName&#34;: &#34;first(firstName)&#34;, &#34;lastName&#34;: &#34;first(lastName)&#34;, &#34;skills&#34;: &#34;first(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds the contact with more skills per company and sorts the result by skills and last name var records_09 = sys.data.find('contacts', {sort: {&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;: &#39;desc&#39;}}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, firstName: &#39;first(firstName)&#39;, lastName: &#39;first(lastName)&#39;, skills: &#39;first(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}, {sort: {&#39;skills&#39;: &#39;desc&#39;, &#39;lastName&#39;: &#39;asc&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_09.count()); while (records_09.hasNext()) { log(records_09.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company and sorts the result by skills and last name var query_09 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.sort().by(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;, &#39;desc&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;firstName&#39;).first(&#39;firstName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;lastName&#39;).first(&#39;lastName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;skills&#39;).first(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); query.sort().by(&#39;skills&#39;, &#39;desc&#39;).by(&#39;lastName&#39;, &#39;asc&#39;); var records_09 = sys.data.find(query_09); log('total: '+records_09.count()); while (records_09.hasNext()) { log(records_09.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company and sorts the result by skills and last name GET /data/contacts?{&#34;sort&#34;: {&#34;numberOfSkills&#34;: &#34;desc&#34;}}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;firstName&#34;: &#34;first(firstName)&#34;, &#34;lastName&#34;: &#34;first(lastName)&#34;, &#34;skills&#34;: &#34;first(numberOfSkills)&#34;}}, {&#34;sort&#34;: {&#34;skills&#34;: &#34;desc&#34;, &#34;lastName&#34;: &#34;asc&#34;}} Project # The Project operation allows you to remove fields from records and reduce memory usage. This is important if you need to process many records but only need a few fields.
Here are some samples of how to use it:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // leaves only number of employees and the sums up var records_10 = sys.data.find('companies', {project: &#39;name,numberOfEmployees&#39;}); log('total: '+records_10.count()); while (records_10.hasNext()) { log(records_10.next().label()); } // leaves only number of employees and the sums up var query_10 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') query.project().field(&#39;name&#39;).field(&#39;numberOfEmployees&#39;); var records_10 = sys.data.find(query_10); log('total: '+records_10.count()); while (records_10.hasNext()) { log(records_10.next().label()); } // leaves only number of employees and the sums up GET /data/contacts?{&#34;project&#34;: &#34;name,numberOfEmployees&#34;} When you run the above query, you will get output like this:
{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c8349&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Photolist&quot;,&quot;numberOfEmployees&quot;:83} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d62e4b0ce322b0c6268&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;DabZ&quot;,&quot;numberOfEmployees&quot;:635} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d60e4b0ce322b0c50f0&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mydo&quot;,&quot;numberOfEmployees&quot;:917} {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d64e4b0ce322b0c7d12&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Zazio&quot;,&quot;numberOfEmployees&quot;:618} ... You can see that only the fields name and numberOfEmployees were included in the output (and id that is always there).
Group # The Group operation is the most important operation in your aggregation pipeline as it aggregates data. It allows you to group a set of records based on some fields and accumulate the results of those records into a field.
For example:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // calculate the total number of skills per company var records_11 = sys.data.find('contacts', {project: &#39;company,numberOfSkills&#39;}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, totalSkills: &#39;sum(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_11.count()); while (records_11.hasNext()) { log(records_11.next().label()); } // calculate the total number of skills per company var query_11 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.project().field(&#39;company&#39;).field(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;totalSkills&#39;).sum(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_11 = sys.data.find(query_11); log('total: '+records_11.count()); while (records_11.hasNext()) { log(records_11.next().label()); } // calculate the total number of skills per company GET /data/contacts?{&#34;project&#34;: &#34;company,numberOfSkills&#34;}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;totalSkills&#34;: &#34;sum(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} For this query, you will get a result set like this:
{&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d60e4b0ce322b0c503d&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Jabbercube&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:4} {&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d63e4b0ce322b0c75b0&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Skilith&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:4} {&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c5dc6&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Trupe&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:4} {&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d60e4b0ce322b0c4c22&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Feedbug&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:8} {&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d62e4b0ce322b0c65ce&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Realcube&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:8} {&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c530d&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Flashset&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:12} {&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d60e4b0ce322b0c51fe&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Thoughtworks&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:8} {&quot;company&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;57fd2d60e4b0ce322b0c4e02&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Mynte&quot;},&quot;totalSkills&quot;:0} Here, you can see how data was grouped by the fields indicated in the by option (in this case, the company field), and then you have accumulators defined that are added as fields in the output (in this case, the totalSkills field).
Basically, the by option indicates how records will be grouped. Records that have the same value(s) in the fields listed in this option will belong to the same group. You can put more than one field if you separate the names using commas or call by() multiple times in the query builder.
Then you can define any number of accumulators. Each accumulator will be a field in the output and must use one of the accumulator operations available:
count()
This operation returns the number of records in the group. For example, you can count the number of contacts for each company.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // counts contacts on each company var records_12 = sys.data.find('contacts', {project: &#39;company&#39;}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, numberOfContacts: &#39;count()&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_12.count()); while (records_12.hasNext()) { log(records_12.next().label()); } // counts contacts on each company var query_12 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.project().field(&#39;company&#39;).field(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;numberOfContacts&#39;).count(); var records_12 = sys.data.find(query_12); log('total: '+records_12.count()); while (records_12.hasNext()) { log(records_12.next().label()); } // counts contacts on each company GET /data/contacts?{&#34;project&#34;: &#34;company&#34;}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;numberOfContacts&#34;: &#34;count()&#34;}} sum(field)
This operation calculates the sum of the values in a specified field for the records in the group. For example, you can calculate the total number of skills per company.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // calculate the total number of skills per company var records_13 = sys.data.find('contacts', {project: &#39;company,numberOfSkills&#39;}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, totalSkills: &#39;sum(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_13.count()); while (records_13.hasNext()) { log(records_13.next().label()); } // calculate the total number of skills per company var query_13 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.project().field(&#39;company&#39;).field(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;totalSkills&#39;).sum(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_13 = sys.data.find(query_13); log('total: '+records_13.count()); while (records_13.hasNext()) { log(records_13.next().label()); } // calculate the total number of skills per company GET /data/contacts?{&#34;project&#34;: &#34;company,numberOfSkills&#34;}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;totalSkills&#34;: &#34;sum(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} This only works for number fields like integer, money, decimal or percentage.
avg(field)
This operation calculates the average of the values in a specified field for the records in the group. It works for number fields like integer, money, decimal, or percentage.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // calculate the average number of skills per company per contact var records_14 = sys.data.find('contacts', {project: &#39;company,numberOfSkills&#39;}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, avgSkills: &#39;avg(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_14.count()); while (records_14.hasNext()) { log(records_14.next().label()); } // calculate the average number of skills per company per contact var query_14 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.project().field(&#39;company&#39;).field(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;avgSkills&#39;).avg(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_14 = sys.data.find(query_14); log('total: '+records_14.count()); while (records_14.hasNext()) { log(records_14.next().label()); } // calculate the average number of skills per company per contact GET /data/contacts?{&#34;project&#34;: &#34;company,numberOfSkills&#34;}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;avgSkills&#34;: &#34;avg(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} Keep in mind that if the value of the field is null or the field isn&rsquo;t present at all in the record it won&rsquo;t count for the average calculation.
first(field)
This operation selects the value of the first record as the value of the output. It is often used in combination with the sort operator to find the first value of a field.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds the contact with more skills per company var records_15 = sys.data.find('contacts', {sort: {&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;: &#39;desc&#39;}}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, firstName: &#39;first(firstName)&#39;, lastName: &#39;first(lastName)&#39;, skills: &#39;first(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_15.count()); while (records_15.hasNext()) { log(records_15.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company var query_15 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.sort().by(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;, &#39;desc&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;firstName&#39;).first(&#39;firstName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;lastName&#39;).first(&#39;lastName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;skills&#39;).first(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_15 = sys.data.find(query_15); log('total: '+records_15.count()); while (records_15.hasNext()) { log(records_15.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company GET /data/contacts?{&#34;sort&#34;: {&#34;numberOfSkills&#34;: &#34;desc&#34;}}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;firstName&#34;: &#34;first(firstName)&#34;, &#34;lastName&#34;: &#34;first(lastName)&#34;, &#34;skills&#34;: &#34;first(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} last(field)
This operation selects the value of the last record as the value of the output. It is often used in combination with the sort operator to find the last value of a field.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds the contact with more skills per company var records_16 = sys.data.find('contacts', {sort: {&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;: &#39;asc&#39;}}, {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, firstName: &#39;last(firstName)&#39;, lastName: &#39;last(lastName)&#39;, skills: &#39;last(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_16.count()); while (records_16.hasNext()) { log(records_16.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company var query_16 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.sort().by(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;, &#39;asc&#39;); query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;firstName&#39;).last(&#39;firstName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;lastName&#39;).last(&#39;lastName&#39;).accumulate(&#39;skills&#39;).last(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_16 = sys.data.find(query_16); log('total: '+records_16.count()); while (records_16.hasNext()) { log(records_16.next().label()); } // finds the contact with more skills per company GET /data/contacts?{&#34;sort&#34;: {&#34;numberOfSkills&#34;: &#34;asc&#34;}}, {&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;firstName&#34;: &#34;last(firstName)&#34;, &#34;lastName&#34;: &#34;last(lastName)&#34;, &#34;skills&#34;: &#34;last(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} max(field)
This operation selects the maximum value from all records as the value of the output.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds the maximum number of skills per company for one contact var records_17 = sys.data.find('contacts', {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, skills: &#39;max(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_17.count()); while (records_17.hasNext()) { log(records_17.next().label()); } // finds the maximum number of skills per company for one contact var query_17 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;skills&#39;).max(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_17 = sys.data.find(query_17); log('total: '+records_17.count()); while (records_17.hasNext()) { log(records_17.next().label()); } // finds the maximum number of skills per company for one contact GET /data/contacts?{&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;skills&#34;: &#34;max(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} min(field)
This operation selects the minimum value from all records as the value of the output.
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds the minimum number of skills per company for one contact var records_18 = sys.data.find('contacts', {group: {by: &#39;company&#39;, skills: &#39;min(numberOfSkills)&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_18.count()); while (records_18.hasNext()) { log(records_18.next().label()); } // finds the minimum number of skills per company for one contact var query_18 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') query.group().by(&#39;company&#39;).accumulate(&#39;skills&#39;).min(&#39;numberOfSkills&#39;); var records_18 = sys.data.find(query_18); log('total: '+records_18.count()); while (records_18.hasNext()) { log(records_18.next().label()); } // finds the minimum number of skills per company for one contact GET /data/contacts?{&#34;group&#34;: {&#34;by&#34;: &#34;company&#34;, &#34;skills&#34;: &#34;min(numberOfSkills)&#34;}} Limitations # These aggregation operations allow you to perform various calculations and data manipulations in your aggregated queries. However, it&rsquo;s essential to keep in mind that aggregated queries work well for small to moderate-sized datasets. If you need to analyze large datasets, it&rsquo;s recommended to use dedicated data analysis tools and services like Google BigQuery or Amazon Redshift.

Value is 10: 10 Value is 5 or 9: 5,9 Value ranges from 0 to 10 (inclusive): 0..10 Value is greater than 10: &gt;10 Value is less than or equal to 20 or greater than or equal to 50: &lt;=20,&gt;=50 Not all types support all features, so it&rsquo;s important to check which features are supported by each type in its respective documentation.
These queries do not have a public REST API and can only be utilized through the UI.
Matching of values # Most text types default to using the &ldquo;like&rdquo; operator for matching values. For example, relationship, text, users, groups, etc., will use the &ldquo;like&rdquo; operator when matching values.
On the other hand, types like integer, time, date, etc., default to using the &ldquo;equals&rdquo; operator to match values.
If you want to force an &ldquo;equals&rdquo; match when the default is &ldquo;like,&rdquo; you can use =. For instance, if you want to match the word TEST exactly in a text field, you should use =TEST instead of just TEST.
Some types allow the use of special values for matching. For example, date fields support expressions like tomorrow or next 3 days. Make sure to consult the type&rsquo;s documentation to determine the default matching operator for values and if any special values are available for use.
Finally, you can match empty values by using a dash: -. This will match all records where the value of the field is empty.
Operators # These are the operators you can use for each field. Please refer to each type&rsquo;s documentation to determine which features are supported.
Multiple values # You can specify multiple values by separating them with commas. For example:
Value is like one, two, or three: one,two,three You can use &quot; when dealing with commas in the text. For example, the value should be like one,two or three: &quot;one,two&quot;,three You can use it with various different types. For example, for integers: 3,5,7 You can also combine them with other operators. For example, values ranging from 0 to 10 or from 20 to 30: 0..10,20..30 Between # This operator allows you to specify a range of values, which is useful for numeric types or date types. In this case, you should use the format from..to. Here are some examples:
Filter by integer field with values between 0 and 10 (inclusive): 0..10 Filter by decimal field with values between 2.5 and 4.5 (inclusive): 2.5..4.5 Filter by date field with values between 2016-07-01 and 2016-07-15: 2016-07-01..2016-07-15 Filter by time field with values between 09:00 and 12:00: 09:00..12:00 Less than # This operator allows you to specify the maximum value (exclusive) of a field, which is useful for numeric types or date types. In this case, you should use the format &lt;maxValue. Here are some examples:
Filter by integer field with values less than 10: &lt;10 Filter by decimal field with values less than 2.75: &lt;2.75 Filter by date field with values less than 2016-07-01: &lt;2016-07-01 Filter by time field with values less than 12:00: &lt;12:00 Less than or equal to # This operator allows you to specify the maximum value (inclusive) of a field, which is useful for numeric types or date types. In this case, you should use the format &lt;=maxValue. Here are some examples:
Filter by integer field with values less than or equal to 10: &lt;=10 Filter by decimal field with values less than or equal to 2.75: &lt;=2.75 Filter by date field with values less than or equal to 2016-07-01: &lt;=2016-07-01 Filter by time field with values less than or equal to 12:00: &lt;=12:00 Greater than # This operator allows you to specify the minimum value (exclusive) of a field, which is useful for numeric types or date types. In this case, you should use the format &gt;minValue. Here are some examples:
Filter by integer field with values greater than 10: &gt;10 Filter by decimal field with values greater than 2.75: &gt;2.75 Filter by date field with values greater than 2016-07-01: &gt;2016-07-01 Filter by time field with values greater than 12:00: &gt;12:00 Greater than or equal to # This operator allows you to specify the minimum value (inclusive) of a field, which is useful for numeric types or date types.

Create the field &ldquo;Assignee&rdquo; on tasks # To start, let&rsquo;s create the new field for tasks:
Right-click on the node Model &gt; Entities &gt; Tasks &gt; Fields, and select New Field from the dropdown menu.
Fill in the form with the following details:
Label: Assignee Name: assignee Type: Relationship Related entity: System &gt; Users Click on Create and Edit.
Set the Default value to Script.
Complete the field Script.
return sys.context.getCurrentUserRecord(); Save the changes. Create &ldquo;Managers&rdquo; group # Now let’s add the two new groups:
Click the node Security &gt; Groups.
Click on the Create button on the top-right of the page.
Fill in the form with:
Label: Manager Name: manager Click on Create and Edit.
Now we need to add permissions to access entities and views. Click on the node Security &gt; Groups &gt; Manager &gt; Entity permissions.
Select the Task entity and then click on Apply permissions:
There select the option Read/write and click on Apply.
Then click on the configuration button under the Edit column, and configure fields permissions so fields Status and Rank are read-only.
This is the correct way to enforce permissions instead of just making the field read-only in the UI. Now, select the System &gt; Users entity and then click on Apply permissions, and this time select Read-Only.
Finally, click the Apply button on the top-right of the listing to persist changes.
Click on the node Security &gt; Groups &gt; Manager &gt; View permissions.
Set the flag in the column Permission for both views:
Finally, click the Apply button on the top-right of the listing to persist changes. Create a &ldquo;Support&rdquo; group # Now that we have our first group, create a new group called Support, and add some permissions to it:
Click on the node Security &gt; Groups &gt; Support &gt; Entity permissions.
In the Tasks entity, click on the configuration button under the Edit column.
Configure entity permissions like this:
Configure field permissions like this: Configure action permissions like this: Click on Apply.
Now, select the System &gt; Users entity, click on Apply permissions, and select Read-Only.
Save changes by clicking on Apply.
Configure view permissions in Security &gt; Groups &gt; Support &gt; View permissions in the same way as for managers.
Now that we have created the groups and defined their permissions, let&rsquo;s push the changes so we can use these groups when creating users.
Create different users # It&rsquo;s time to create a few users (make sure you have pushed the changes before):
Click on the node Security &gt; Users.
Click on the Create button at the top right of the page.
Fill in the form with:
First name: Manager1 Last name: Test Email: manager1@test.com Generate Password: true Groups: Add the Manager group as Primary Click on Create to save the user. Then repeat the same process for these users:
First name Last name Email Primary group Support1 Test support1@test.com Support Support2 Test support2@test.com Support You don't need to push changes when working with users because users are modified directly in the runtime as they aren't part of the metadata of the app. 😊
Awesome! We have finished this section and are almost done with our app.
In the next section, we will learn how to work with different users in the runtime.

To access the Slingr API, you can make requests to the following endpoint:`,content:`The Slingr API provides a versatile means of interacting with your app&rsquo;s data, executing actions, checking job statuses, reviewing logs, and more, all via a straightforward REST interface. Essentially, anything that can be accomplished through the app&rsquo;s user interface can also be achieved using these web services.
The Slingr API adheres to REST principles, although there may be some variations. Our primary data format is JSON.
To access the Slingr API, you can make requests to the following endpoint:
https://&lt;appName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/api Where:
&lt;appName&gt; is the name of your app. &lt;env&gt; is the name of the environment, such as dev or prod. Please note that HTTPS must always be used. Attempting to access our API via HTTP will result in an error.
All API requests should include the following headers:
- Content-Type: application/json - Accept: application/json - token: &lt;token_received_after_login&gt; General error codes # Here is a list of common HTTP status codes used in the Slingr API along with their descriptions:
HTTP Status Code Description 200 OK: The request was successful, and there are no errors. 400 Bad Request: The request is invalid. This can occur due to validation errors in the data you are sending or because the requested operation is not valid. 401 Unauthorized: You are not authorized to access this resource. You need to log in or the provided authentication token is not valid. 403 Forbidden: You have valid credentials, but you are attempting to access data or perform an operation for which you do not have the necessary permissions. 404 Not Found: The resource you are trying to access does not exist. 409 Conflict: This error occurs in the case of an optimistic locking exception. It happens when two users attempt to update the same record simultaneously, and the second user to make the update receives this error. 500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected internal error has occurred. If you encounter this error, please contact our support team as it indicates an issue on our end. 503 Service Unavailable: This error is returned when the application is undergoing maintenance and is temporarily unavailable. For specific details on errors related to each API method, please refer to the documentation for that specific method.
Authentication # Before you can make requests to the Slingr API, you must log in and obtain a valid token. Follow the steps below to acquire and utilize the token.
To obtain a token, make a POST request to the following URL:
POST /auth/login This method has no additional parameters, and the request body should have the following structure:
{ &quot;email&quot;: &quot;user@test.com&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;abcdefgh&quot; } The response will resemble the following:
{ &quot;app&quot;: &quot;appname&quot;, &quot;adminUserEmail&quot;: null, &quot;ip&quot;: &quot;::ffff:10.240.0.38&quot;, &quot;userEmail&quot;: &quot;user@test.com&quot;, &quot;userName&quot;: &quot;User Test&quot;, &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;57fce0c3e4b0ce322b0c06b2&quot;, &quot;token&quot;: &quot;eLJjYSjLUPLlIEe8lfJUOmzsVNvSRpOv&quot; } It will include the following fields:
Field Name Description app The code of the app to which the token belongs. adminUserEmail This field is used when impersonating another user. Refer to the following section for more details. ip The IP address from which the user logged in. userEmail The email address of the user you have logged in with. userName The full name of the user you have logged in with. userId The unique identifier of the user you have logged in with. token The most critical field, containing the token necessary for subsequent API requests. Keep in mind that this token may expire, so ensure your integration can handle token expiration. Once you have acquired the token, include it in the header of every API request as follows:
GET /data/companies &gt; Accept: application/json &gt; token: eLJjYSjLUPLlIEe8lfJUOmzsVNvSRpOv Be aware that tokens have a limited lifespan, typically expiring after 8 hours of inactivity. However, they may expire sooner due to maintenance or other internal tasks. If your token expires, you will receive a 401 error, indicating that you need to log in again.
Please ensure the security and confidentiality of your access token, as it provides authentication to your Slingr account.
Impersonating other users # Developer users or users with the appropriate permissions, such as the &ldquo;manage groups&rdquo; flag, have the capability to impersonate other users for various purposes. To perform user impersonation when logging in, you should include the following structure in the request body:
{ &quot;email&quot;: &quot;manager@test.com&quot;, &quot;password&quot;: &quot;manager_password&quot;, &quot;emailImpersonatedUser&quot;: &quot;employee@test.com&quot; } username: Your own username for authentication. password: Your own password for authentication. adminUserEmail: The email address of the user you wish to impersonate. When you provide the adminUserEmail field in the request body, you will log in as the specified user with their permissions and privileges. This feature is particularly valuable for testing and administrative purposes, allowing authorized users to perform actions on behalf of different users.
Ensure that user impersonation is used responsibly and only by users with the necessary permissions to prevent any unauthorized actions within the system.
The token response will include fields that reflect the impersonation scenario. Here&rsquo;s an example of what the response might look like:
{ &quot;app&quot;: &quot;appname&quot;, &quot;adminUserEmail&quot;: &quot;manager@test.com&quot;, &quot;ip&quot;: &quot;::ffff:10.240.0.39&quot;, &quot;userEmail&quot;: &quot;employee@test.com&quot;, &quot;userName&quot;: &quot;Employee Test&quot;, &quot;userId&quot;: &quot;57fe52ade4b0ce322b0cea32&quot;, &quot;token&quot;: &quot;NE8lUuA2Yi9K6gL9EaQaTLIQLvYIhIyv&quot; } Possible errors # When making login requests to the API, you may encounter the following error codes and their corresponding HTTP status codes along with their descriptions:
Error Code HTTP Status Code Description unauthorized 401 This error is thrown when the provided credentials are invalid. It can occur when either the user email does not exist or the password does not match. notFound 404 Indicates that the user you are trying to impersonate does not exist. forbidden 403 If the credentials are valid but you are not allowed to log in. This can happen due to various reasons, such as IP restrictions or attempting to impersonate a user without sufficient permissions. badRequest 400 Denotes a malformed request. For instance, this error occurs when the mandatory fields such as email and password are not provided in the request. applicationUnavailable 503 If the application is currently suspended or undergoing maintenance. Developer users may still have the capability to log in despite this condition. These error codes provide specific information about the issues encountered during the login process and can help troubleshoot any authentication problems effectively.
App data # For each entity within the app, a set of methods is automatically generated. For instance, if there is an entity named companies, the following methods will be available:
GET /data/companies GET /data/companies/{id} PUT /data/companies/{id} POST /data/companies DELETE /data/companies/{ids} These fundamental operations are available for every entity and enable you to perform common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your app&rsquo;s data.
The structure of the data returned or manipulated by these methods is determined by the fields defined within each entity. For example, when fetching a company record, the response will resemble the following:
{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8665&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: 379, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Browsezoom&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Browsezoom&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;pending&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;numberOfEmployees&quot;: 95, &quot;isCustomer&quot;: false, &quot;contactInformation&quot;: { &quot;phoneNumber&quot;: &quot;1-702-845-9380&quot;, &quot;email&quot;: &quot;jwoodsrq@spotify.com&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;58837fdd3b063a0007603547&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Contact Information&quot; }, &quot;addresses&quot;: [ { &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;4 Magdeline Place&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;89145&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NV&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd45aee4b0ce322b0c86aa&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;NV - 89145&quot; } ], &quot;homepage&quot;: &quot;http://www.browsezoom.com&quot;, &quot;taxId&quot;: &quot;350-KWM&quot;, &quot;rating&quot;: &quot;2.8&quot;, &quot;notes&quot;: &quot;modified notes&quot;, &quot;lastMeeting&quot;: 1429623180000, &quot;lastUpdate&quot;: 1485012900000 } There are basically two types of fields:
Record fields: Record fields are fields defined within each entity of your app. The format and characteristics of these fields depend on the data type assigned to them during entity creation. The types can include text, numbers, dates, and more. For specific details about the types and their format, please refer to the types documentation.
System fields: System fields are inherent to every record in your app and are automatically included. They provide essential information about the record and are crucial for various functionalities. The system fields include:
id: This is the unique identifier for each record. It is used to distinguish one record from another.
label: The label field contains the record&rsquo;s label, which is generated based on the instance label expression defined within the entity. This label is often used for display purposes and makes it easier to identify records.
version: The version field represents the record&rsquo;s version and is primarily used for optimistic locking. Optimistic locking ensures that record updates are synchronized and avoids conflicts when multiple users attempt to modify the same record simultaneously.
Understanding both record fields and system fields is essential for effectively working with your app&rsquo;s data and ensuring the integrity and consistency of your records. You can incorporate this revised information into your documentation to provide a clear distinction between record fields and system fields and their respective roles in your app&rsquo;s data.

Data is sent in the body and should be valid according to the entity structure and fields rules.
Request # To update a record via the API, you should provide a JSON-formatted record in the request body. The fields you include in this JSON body must align with the structure defined in the entity. Additionally, the values must conform to the format required by the data type assigned to each field. Be aware that there might be validation rules enforced by the entity that you need to adhere to.
Key points to consider when sending an update request:
You can specify only the fields you wish to update. Fields that are not included in the JSON request body won&rsquo;t be modified. If you want to clear a field&rsquo;s value, set it to null explicitly.
An essential field to mention is version, which signifies the version of the record you are updating. This field is crucial for managing concurrency issues, especially when two users attempt to update the same record simultaneously. (Refer to the optimistic locking section below for further details.) If you do not provide the version field, your update will always overwrite existing data, regardless of other user modifications.
Please make sure to structure your update requests accordingly, taking into account the entity&rsquo;s schema, data type requirements, and any validation rules in place.

It accomplishes this by utilizing a record version, represented as a numerical value that increments each time a record undergoes modification.
When updating a record, if you include the version field within the request body and this version does not match the record&rsquo;s current version on the server, the operation will result in a 409 error. This mechanism effectively safeguards against unintentional overwrites of changes made by other users.
If the version field is omitted from the request, no version control will be applied, potentially leading to the unintentional overwriting of changes made by others. Consequently, it is strongly recommended to always include the version field when updating records.

PUT /data/{entityName}/{id}/{actionName} &gt; Content-Type: application/json &gt; Accept: application/json &gt; token: token { &quot;param1&quot;: &quot;value&quot;, &quot;param2&quot;: value } Parameter Required Description entityName yes Name of the entity the record belongs to. id yes ID of the record to execute the action on. actionName yes The name of the action that has to be executed. _async no This parameter indicates whether the deletion should be executed in the background, which is necessary if the execution is expected to take more than 30 seconds. When you set this parameter to true, the response from this method will provide a reference to the job responsible for executing the deletion.
This parameter will override the default configured in the action. Response # The response varies based on the action type and the _async parameter. There are three possible response scenarios:
1. Record Response (if _async is false and the action type is &lsquo;One record&rsquo;):
When _async is set to false and the action does not return a custom response, this method will return the updated record. This scenario is applicable only to actions of type &lsquo;One record.&rsquo;
2. Custom Action&rsquo;s Response (if _async is false and the action returns a custom response):
When _async is false, and the action returns a custom response, that specific response will be returned. Note that actions of type &lsquo;Many records&rsquo; should always provide a custom response. If they do not return anything, an empty response will be generated.
3. Job Reference (if _async is true):
In cases where _async is set to true, the method will return a reference to the job responsible for executing the action. Once the action is completed, you can locate the response of the action within the job&rsquo;s results.
Below, you can find examples illustrating each of these response types.

Request # This feature allows you to import records from a CSV file into your system. When preparing the CSV file, please adhere to the following rules:
Headers:
Headers in the CSV file should correspond to the field paths you wish to import. For instance, a field named &ldquo;name&rdquo; located at the root of the entity should have &ldquo;name&rdquo; as its header. For nested fields, use the full path, such as &ldquo;address.state.&rdquo; When dealing with multi-valued fields, specify the index, like &ldquo;phoneNumbers[0]&rdquo; or &ldquo;phoneNumbers[1].&rdquo;
Data Format:
The data format in the CSV file should match the type of each field being imported. Refer to the documentation for each field type to ensure you are using the correct format.
Template Creation:
To create a CSV file template, you can often export existing records using field names instead of labels as a starting point.
Record Handling:
Records will be created if they do not already exist in the system. If records already exist, they will be updated. To determine if a record exists, a unique field must be included in the CSV file&rsquo;s headers. If multiple unique fields are present, the first one encountered will be used. Importing into Related Entities:
It is also possible to import records into related entities. For example, if you have a &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; entity with a relationship called &ldquo;company&rdquo; pointing to the &ldquo;companies&rdquo; entity, your CSV file headers can reflect this relationship structure:
company.name,company.type,firstName,lastName,email Your CSV file includes headers like &ldquo;company.name&rdquo; and &ldquo;company.type&rdquo; referring to fields within the &ldquo;companies&rdquo; entity. In this scenario:
The import process will attempt to match an existing company based on the &ldquo;name&rdquo; field (assuming &ldquo;name&rdquo; is a unique field) and update its &ldquo;type&rdquo; field if a match is found.
If no match is found, a new record will be created in the &ldquo;companies&rdquo; entity, and it will be associated with the record in the &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; entity. This enables you to create records in multiple entities with just a single import.
The entire import process occurs within the context of a background job, ensuring efficient handling of the data.
POST /data/{entityName}/import &gt; Content-Type: multipart/form-data &gt; Accept: application/json &gt; token: token Parameter Required Default Description entityName Yes - Specifies the name of the entity to which the record belongs. file Yes - Indicates the multi-part CSV file to be imported. lowPriority No - When set, the import process is scheduled to execute when there are fewer concurrent jobs running. This is particularly useful for large imports to prevent delays in other job executions. updateCalculatedFields No True Allows you to expedite large imports by skipping the recalculation of calculated fields. However, this may result in calculated fields having outdated values, which can be recalculated later. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) updateRelationships No True Controls whether an import updating a record&rsquo;s label triggers a cascade update in related records. Disabling this feature can improve performance for large imports. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) performValidations No True By setting this to false, you can skip type-based validations during import. Structural and data format validations remain active, ensuring data integrity. For example, an integer field may skip max and min value validations but still require a numeric value. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) filterByAccessRules No True Determines whether fields should be filtered based on access rules. Disabling this feature results in importing all fields regardless of their accessibility, potentially enhancing import performance. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) performSecurityChecks No True When set to false, security permissions are bypassed during import. This can improve performance or mitigate certain issues during the import process. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) triggerEvents No True Governs the execution of event listeners associated with record creation or updates. If disabled (set to false), these listeners will not be triggered. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) setDefaultValues No True Controls whether default values are calculated for fields during import. Disabling this feature can enhance performance during large imports. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) supportTransientFields No True Decides whether transient fields are managed as transient during import. Disabling this feature may improve performance in large imports. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) cascadeOperations No True Specifies whether importing or updating records can trigger various cascade operations, such as copying fields or aggregating data. Setting this to false prevents these operations. (Note: This option is intended for developers.) skipRecordsWithInvalidFields No True Determines the treatment of records with invalid fields (validation errors). If set to false, records will be created or updated with errors that must be corrected later. (Note: This option is intended for developers.)

You have the flexibility to apply filters to determine which records to export using a query and select specific fields to include in the export.
To specify which fields should be included in the CSV file, you can use the _fields parameter. Its usage is similar to queries, but with a few distinctions:
You can include related fields, which are fields located in the entities pointed to by relationship fields. For instance, if you have a relationship field named &ldquo;company&rdquo; that references the &ldquo;companies&rdquo; entity, you can specify &ldquo;company.type&rdquo; to be included in the CSV file. If you only specify &ldquo;company,&rdquo; only the label will be exported.
If you leave the _fields parameter empty, all fields will be included in the export, except for related fields.
System fields such as &quot;id,&quot; &quot;label,&quot; and &quot;version&quot; are not included in the export.
This flexibility allows you to tailor your CSV exports to your specific needs.

When you need to reference a file within a record using a file field, it&rsquo;s a typical practice to upload the file first. Once you obtain the unique ID of the uploaded file, you can then set it as the value of the corresponding file field in your record.
It&rsquo;s important to note that if a file is not referenced by any record, it will be automatically deleted after a few hours. Therefore, it&rsquo;s advisable to upload files only if you intend to link them to records within your app. Uploading files that are not used within your app is unnecessary and may result in their deletion.
Uploading files # POST /files This function allows you to upload a file to your app. The uploaded file will be stored temporarily until it is referenced by a record. If no record references the file within 12 hours, it will be automatically removed.
Request # To upload a file, you must use a multi-part request. This method supports the uploading of files in any format.

This is the general job structure:
{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;588a02c13b063a0007605032&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Executing action countEmployees on entity companies&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;EXECUTE_ACTION&quot;, &quot;runBy&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fce0c3e4b0ce322b0c06b2&quot;, &quot;fullName&quot;: &quot;Diego Gaviola&quot; }, &quot;parentJob&quot;: null, &quot;rootJob&quot;: null, &quot;createDate&quot;: 1485439681643, &quot;startDate&quot;: 1485439681652, &quot;endDate&quot;: 1485439681807, &quot;status&quot;: &quot;FINISHED&quot;, &quot;hasErrors&quot;: false, &quot;progress&quot;: 100, &quot;recordsCount&quot;: 0, &quot;recordsProcessed&quot;: 0, &quot;childrenJobsCount&quot;: 0, &quot;childrenJobsProcessed&quot;: 0, &quot;stoppable&quot;: true, &quot;lowPriority&quot;: false, &quot;data&quot;: {} &quot;results&quot;: {} } Field Description id Unique identifier for the job. label Name of the job, providing a simple description of its purpose. Be aware that this description may change without notice and should not be used for critical decision-making in your code. type The type of job, which can be one of the following supported types: - IMPORT_RECORDS, - EXPORT_RECORDS, - EXECUTE_ACTION, - DELETE_RECORDS, - EXECUTE_LISTENER, - IMPORT_USERS, - EXPORT_USERS, - STOP_APP, - START_APP, - DEPLOY_ENDPOINT, - UNDEPLOY_ENDPOINT.
Other job types are considered system jobs and should not be relied upon, as they may change or be removed. runBy A map containing the id and fullName of the user who triggered the job. parentJob A map containing the id and label of the parent job. If the job is not a child of another job, this field will be null, indicating it is a root job. rootJob A map containing the id and label of the root job. A root job is one that does not have a parent job. If this field is null, it means the job is a root job. createDate The timestamp in milliseconds when the job was created. startDate The timestamp when the job execution started. It can be null if the job has not yet started. endDate The timestamp when the job execution finished. It can be null if the job has not finished. status The current status of the job, which can be one of the following: PENDING, RUNNING, FINISHED, STOPPING, STOPPED, CANCELED. hasErrors If true, indicates that there was at least one error during the job&rsquo;s execution. You should review the logs and results for details. progress A number from 0 to 100 indicating the progress of the job. Note that some jobs may transition directly from 0 to 100 if there is no intermediate progress information. recordsCount If the job involves working with records, this field indicates the number of records involved. recordsProcessed If the job involves working with records, this field indicates the number of records that have been processed. childrenJobsCount The count of children jobs created during the execution of the job. It starts as 0 and may increase over time as more children jobs are created. childrenJobsProcessed The number of children jobs that have finished execution. stoppable If true, the job can be stopped; otherwise, you must wait for its completion (unless it&rsquo;s still pending). lowPriority If true, the job will be executed only when there are few other jobs running. data The content of this field depends on the job and contains additional parameters.
Start AppFieldDescriptionpushChangesIndicates whether changes will be automatically pushed when starting the application. Set to true if changes will be pushed; otherwise, it&rsquo;s false or empty.wakingUpIndicates whether the application was in a sleeping state and is now in the process of waking up. Set to true if the app is waking up; otherwise, it&rsquo;s false.Import RecordsFieldDescriptionfileNameThe name of the file to be imported.entityNameThe name of the entity where records will be imported.Export RecordsFieldDescriptionentityNameThe name of the entity from which records will be exported.Delete RecordsFieldDescriptionentityNameThe name of the entity from which records will be deleted.Execute ActionFieldDescriptionentityNameThe name of the entity to which the action belongs.actionNameThe name of the action to be executed.Execute ListenerFieldDescriptionlistenerNameThe name of the listener to execute.Import UsersFieldDescriptionfileNameThe name of the file to be imported.notifyUsersIndicates whether people will be notified by email when users are created. Set to true if notifications will be sent; otherwise, it&rsquo;s false.Deploy EndpointPathDescriptionendpointNameThe name of the endpoint to deploy.Undeploy EndpointPathDescriptionendpointNameThe name of the endpoint to undeploy.
results The content of this field depends on the job. Here you will find information about the results of executing the job.
Import RecordsPathDescriptionrowsImportedThe number of rows that were imported successfully.rowsWithErrorsThe number of rows that couldn&rsquo;t be imported due to errors.Export RecordsPathDescriptionfileLinkURL to download the CSV file with the exported records. You will need to send the token in the headers to download it.fileIdThe ID of the file that was generated.recordsExportedThe number of records that were exported.Delete Records
The result will be a map like this one:
{&ldquo;results&rdquo;: {&ldquo;id1&rdquo;: {&ldquo;status&rdquo;: &ldquo;ok&rdquo;,&ldquo;response&rdquo;: &ldquo;response from action&rdquo;},&ldquo;id2&rdquo;: {&ldquo;status&rdquo;: &ldquo;error&rdquo;,&ldquo;errorMessage&rdquo;: &ldquo;error message&rdquo;}}}
status will indicate if the delete process was executed successfully over that record (ok) or if there were errors (error). The field response will be available only if the action is configured to return the response in the results; otherwise it won&rsquo;t be there.
One important thing to keep in mind is that the maximum number of responses in this map will be 1,000. If you execute the delete process over more than 1,000 records, you might not be able to collect the response for each one.Execute ActionThe results of this job depend on the type of action. If the action is of type One record, the result will be a map like this one:
{&ldquo;results&rdquo;: {&ldquo;id1&rdquo;: {&ldquo;status&rdquo;: &ldquo;ok&rdquo;,&ldquo;response&rdquo;: &ldquo;response from action&rdquo;},&ldquo;id2&rdquo;: {&ldquo;status&rdquo;: &ldquo;error&rdquo;,&ldquo;errorMessage&rdquo;: &ldquo;error message&rdquo;}}}
status will indicate if the action was executed successfully over that record (ok) or if there were errors (error). The field response will be available only if the action is configured to return the response in the results; otherwise it won&rsquo;t be there. The field errorMessage will be present when there is an error, providing some insight into the problem. One important thing to keep in mind is that the maximum number of responses in this map will be 1,000. If you execute the action over more than 1,000 records, you might not be able to collect the response for each one.
If the action is of type Many records, you will only get a map with fields status and response:
{&ldquo;results&rdquo;: {&ldquo;status&rdquo;: &ldquo;ok&rdquo;,&ldquo;response&rdquo;: &ldquo;response from action&rdquo;}}Import UsersPathDescriptionfileLinkURL to download the CSV file with the exported users. You will need to send the token in the headers to download it.Export UsersPathDescriptionfileLinkURL to download the CSV file with the exported users. You will need to send the token in the headers to download it.fileIdThe ID of the file that was generated.usersExportedThe number of users that were exported.

To bridge this gap, Slingr offers a solution to auto-generate comprehensive REST API documentation, providing all the details required for seamless API interaction.
Understanding REST APIs # In your app builder, navigate to the Model &gt; REST API section to find a list of APIs associated with your app. While your app technically has one API based on your model, certain features may be restricted depending on the user&rsquo;s permissions. This section allows you to define the permissions for different types of API users you expect.
There will always be one API called Full API, which cannot be deleted. It serves as the API for developer users or individuals with comprehensive permissions. Additionally, you can create other APIs to specify the groups to which API users belong. These groups are instrumental in determining user permissions.
Once you configure a REST API and push changes, you can access the API&rsquo;s documentation at this URL:
https://{{site.slingr_domain}}/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/api/docs/&lt;api-name&gt; Please note that these REST APIs defined here serve the sole purpose of auto-generating documentation. Any user who doesn&rsquo;t belong to the specified groups can still use the API but won&rsquo;t have access to the documentation.
REST API Settings # When creating a new REST API, you must provide the following settings:
Label # A user-friendly, human-readable name for the REST API.
Name # The internal name of the REST API, used in the API documentation&rsquo;s URL. It should consist only of letters and numbers, with no special characters or spaces.
Groups # A list of groups that define the permissions for this REST API. Only the components accessible to these groups will be documented.

Here&rsquo;s the information available for each job:
Create date: Indicates when the job was created. Waiting: Shows the elapsed time between job creation and the start of execution. This value increases while the job is pending. Start date: Marks when the job&rsquo;s execution commenced. Duration: Reflects the time taken for the job to complete since its start date. This value continues to grow while the job is in progress. Status: Indicates the current status of the job, such as &quot;Pending,&quot; &quot;In Progress,&quot; or &quot;Finished.&quot; Errors: Flags the presence of errors during job execution, with detailed information available in the job&rsquo;s logs. Low priority: Marks jobs as low priority, impacting their execution when the app experiences heavy loads. Run by: Identifies the user who triggered the job; it may be empty for system jobs. Progress: Offers an estimate of the job&rsquo;s progress, although some jobs may not update this accurately. Children execution: Shows the progress of child jobs, if any exist. Note that additional child jobs might be created during execution, adjusting the overall progress. Operations on jobs # You can perform several operations on jobs by selecting the relevant jobs:
Stop: Attempts to gracefully halt a running job. After stopping, you can choose to resume it. Please note that certain jobs, such as those executing listeners, may not be stoppable mid-execution and will remain in a &quot;Stopping&quot; state until completion. System jobs may not have the option to stop.
Resume: Resumes the execution of a job in the &quot;Stopped&quot; state, continuing from where it left off.
Force Stop: Forces a job in the &quot;Stopping&quot; state to halt. Use this cautiously, as it may result in inconsistent data if no alternative exists.
Cancel: Discards a job in the &quot;Stopped&quot; state, making it unrecoverable.
Restart: Available for specific job types, this operation re-executes a &quot;Finished&quot; job if necessary.
Set low priority: Marks a job as low priority, scheduling it for execution during low app load periods.
Remove low priority: Removes the low priority flag, ensuring a job is executed as usual.
Logs # For each job, you can access logs specific to its execution. Log searching and filtering function similarly to app logs.
Children jobs # During a job&rsquo;s execution, it may trigger other jobs known as children jobs. These not only help maintain the clarity of the main jobs list but also influence job scheduling. The scheduler allocates execution time based on root jobs (those without parents) to prevent a single job with numerous children from blocking others.
System jobs # You can view system jobs by clicking the &ldquo;Show system jobs&rdquo; button in the secondary menu. System jobs are generated by the platform to perform essential tasks, such as data refactorings or automatic updates to relationship fields.
System jobs are typically not necessary to monitor but can be inspected when needed.
Statistics # In the &quot;Jobs &gt; Statistics&quot; section of the App Monitor, you can find valuable insights into job execution over time, including:
Number of creations: Indicates the total number of jobs created, useful for detecting anomalies in your app.
Average waiting time: Reflects the average duration a job waits before execution. An increase in this value suggests a performance issue, possibly requiring additional app instances.
Min waiting time: Displays the shortest waiting time among jobs before execution.

Logs are organized from the oldest to the newest, and as you scroll down, more logs will be automatically loaded until the entire log history is displayed.
It&rsquo;s important to note that there&rsquo;s a limit on the amount of storage allocated for logs (refer to the &ldquo;Logs and Alerts&rdquo; section). Once this limit is reached, older logs will be rotated out and removed.
Filtering logs # Logs can be filtered based on various criteria, including log level (info, warn, error), time, and a search string. When filtering by time, you can specify a time duration such as &ldquo;5m&rdquo; (for the last five minutes), &ldquo;2h&rdquo; (for the last two hours), or &ldquo;3d&rdquo; (for the last three days). For more precision, you can also use a date range.
The search string allows you to find log entries containing a specific text or regular expression. For example, by using regex: .*GET.*, you can filter logs related to HTTP GET requests.
Additional log details # Two flags, &quot;Show IP&quot; and &quot;Show Location,&quot; provide supplementary information in logs. Enabling &quot;Show IP&quot; displays the IP address of the request source (if available), while &ldquo;Show Location&rdquo; reveals the geographical location (city/state/country) of the request source (if available).
Log categories # You can choose to view specific categories of logs:
&quot;External Only&quot;: Displays logs related to interactions between the app and external systems, such as REST API calls or legacy service interactions.
&quot;UI Only&quot;: Shows logs originating from user interface (UI) requests.
Exploring log details # Some logs contain extensive information that cannot be displayed in a single log line to maintain readability. Look for a &ldquo;More Info&rdquo; button on such logs. Clicking it reveals additional details. For example, in a legacy service event, you can view data sent by the legacy service, error locations within the code, and stack traces—valuable information for debugging.
Contextual log viewing # When filtering logs, you&rsquo;ll find a &ldquo;Context&rdquo; button next to each log entry. Clicking it displays logs both before and after the selected log entry, helping you understand the context of the log without altering your filters.
Alerts # Alerts can be configured based on logs. For instance, in a production environment, you may want to receive alerts when errors or warnings are logged. This can be set up in the App Monitor or App Builder under &ldquo;Environment Settings &gt; Logs and Alerts.&rdquo; Refer to the documentation for more details.

Awesome, we are almost finished with our app. Hopefully, everything is working as expected. But if not, don’t worry! In the next section, we will learn how to find out what’s going on by using the app monitor.
`}),e.add({id:166,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/monitoring/endpoints/",title:"Legacy services management",description:`In the App Monitor&rsquo;s &quot;legacy services&quot; section, you can gain insights into the status and details of your application&rsquo;s legacy services. These legacy services are essential for integrating your app with external services and systems. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll find in this section:
Status: Indicates whether the legacy service is currently deployed, undeployed, or in an intermediate status.

These legacy services are essential for integrating your app with external services and systems. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll find in this section:
Status: Indicates whether the legacy service is currently deployed, undeployed, or in an intermediate status.
Last 24 Hours Activity: Provides data on the number of function calls and events received in the past 24 hours.
Running Instances: Displays the number of active instances for each of your legacy services.
Configuration Details: By clicking on a specific legacy service, you can access its detailed configuration settings.
Managing legacy services # You can perform various operations on your legacy services to ensure they are running as expected:
Deploy: If an legacy service is undeployed, you can activate it by selecting it and clicking the Deploy button.
Undeploy: If an legacy service is deployed but you no longer need it, you can deactivate it by selecting it and clicking the Undeploy button. After undeploying, the endpoint will cease to function, and no further calls or events will be processed, conserving resources.
Redeploy: This option restarts selected legacy services. It can be useful when changes have been made to configuration through environment variables or when there are unusual behavior patterns in a legacy service.
Legacy services configuration # Configuring legacy services to align with your app&rsquo;s requirements is crucial. You can customize various settings:
Generate Token: Legacy services are typically secured with a token to enable communication from external sources. You can regenerate this token here if it is compromised or for security reasons.
Profile: Some legacy services offer different memory profiles, which can be tailored to factors such as the size of your team or usage patterns.
Multiple Instances: If supported, you can adjust the number of instances for an legacy service. Increasing instances can enhance the legacy service&rsquo;s capacity to handle higher loads for your integrations.
Hide Logs Content: For legacy services that process sensitive information, enabling this flag ensures that any sensitive data is not logged. This is particularly important for legacy services dealing with confidential information, such as credit card processing in production.
Managing your legacy services efficiently ensures the smooth operation of your app&rsquo;s integrations and external interactions.

Database information # At the top of the page, you&rsquo;ll find essential information about your data:
Total Database Size: This represents the total storage space used by your database, considered for billing and plans.
App Storage: The space allocated to your app&rsquo;s data, including records within your entities, associated indexes, and historical logs.
System Storage: This portion of the database is dedicated to system-related information such as logs, jobs, indexes, and more.
Entities # The list of entities provides detailed information on each entity:
Total Data Size: This indicates the overall space used by records within the entity, including associated indexes.
Data Size: The space used solely by records within the entity, excluding indexes.
Entries Count: Displays the total number of records stored in the entity.
Indexes Size: Represents the space used by indexes associated with the entity.
Number of Indexes: Indicates the total number of indexes configured for the entity.
Percentage Relative to Data: This provides insight into how much space the entity occupies compared to the total database size.
By clicking on an entity, you can access more detailed information, including index statuses and two critical operations:
Refresh Relationships: Use this operation if your relationship fields become outdated. Running this action updates relationship fields across all records within the entity.
Refresh Calculated Fields: When your calculated fields contain outdated values, use this operation. It updates calculated fields across all records within the entity.
Performance # The &ldquo;Performance&rdquo; section is dedicated to monitoring slow queries. This is crucial if you&rsquo;re experiencing performance issues in your app. You can identify which operations are consuming more time and make informed decisions about creating indexes or making adjustments to enhance your app&rsquo;s performance.
Tools # Under the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; section, you&rsquo;ll find maintenance utilities for your database:
Repair Database: Trigger this option to initiate cleanup tasks that can resolve unusual behaviors in your app. For instance, if you notice discrepancies in record counts within an entity, using this tool might rectify the issue. Files information # At the top of the page, you&rsquo;ll find data on your app&rsquo;s files:
Total Files Size: This is the cumulative space occupied by both public and private files.
Private Files: These files reside in file fields within your app. Learn more about the &ldquo;File&rdquo; field type here.
Public Files: These files can be managed within the app builder. To learn more about public files, refer to the Public Files documentation.

App explorer # The App Explorer provides a view of your app&rsquo;s metadata in its current runtime state. It&rsquo;s important to note that this metadata might differ from what you see in the App Builder if you haven&rsquo;t pushed all your changes. In production environments, the App Explorer is the sole method for exploring metadata, as there is no App Builder instance available.
Storage # The Storage section in the App Monitor allows you to interact with the temporary key-value storage engine of your app. Here&rsquo;s what you can do:
View Existing Key-Value Pairs: Inspect the key-value pairs currently stored in the storage engine.
Edit Value of an Existing Key: Modify the value associated with an existing key.
Create New Key-Value Pairs: Add new key-value pairs to the storage engine.
Clear Storage: Remove all key-value pairs from the storage engine, providing a clean slate for your app&rsquo;s temporary data.
Users management # In the Users section of the App Monitor, you gain the capability to manage users within your app environment. For comprehensive details on user management, please refer to our Users Management documentation.
Console # The Console is a powerful tool for executing scripts directly within your app&rsquo;s runtime. This functionality is particularly useful for maintenance tasks, such as mass updates to records in response to unexpected events. Rather than manually updating records one by one, you can write a script to make the necessary changes and execute it from the console.
When you execute a script in the console, a job is created to execute it. All logs generated during the job&rsquo;s execution are displayed in the console output. You can add logs to the job using methods likesys.jobs.logInfo() or sys.jobs.logError(). There&rsquo;s also a convenient shortcut for logging when executing scripts in the console, which is log():
for (var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { log('i: '+i); } Please note that logs generated using sys.jobs.logInfo() or sys.jobs.logError() will appear in the app logs, not in the console output.
REST API # In the REST API section of the App Monitor, you can access essential information about the REST API calls made to your app over time:
Number of Calls: Displays the total number of API calls made to your app.
Average Response Time: Represents the average response time for API calls. If you observe a consistent increase in this value, it might be an indicator that you need to either scale up your app by adding more instances or increase the resource allocation to your existing instances.
Minimum Response Time: Indicates the shortest response time observed for API calls to your app.
Maximum Response Time: Highlights the longest response time recorded for API calls to your app.

For instance, if you set it to 10,000, the subsequent value will be 10,000. This setting proves useful when you want numbers to initiate from a specific value.
It&rsquo;s important to note that this setting doesn&rsquo;t affect pre-existing records. Moreover, if you modify the value to a number lower than the current auto-increment value, it will not have any impact. For example, if the last created record was assigned the number 3,000 and you alter the minimum value to 1,000, this change will not influence the next value, which will still be 3,001.

Limit decimals # This feature enables the limitation of the number of decimals. This limitation will be applied at the data level, meaning numbers will be stored in the database with the specified number of decimals, and any additional decimals will be discarded. If you wish to retain the additional decimals for display purposes while limiting their storage, you should configure these settings within the display options.
When you opt to limit the number of decimals, the following choices will be presented:
Number of Decimals: This indicates the number of decimals to be stored. It can range from 0 to 4.
Extra Decimals Action: This specifies the action to take when there are more decimals than the limit permits. The available options include:
Round: Rounding will be used to limit the decimals. Truncate: Truncation will be applied to the trailing decimals. Throw Error: An error will be triggered if an attempt is made to set more decimals than the allowable limit. Display options # Show Thousands Separator: If this flag is enabled, the thousands separator will be displayed in read-only mode. Please note that this flag does not impact edit mode.
Limit Number of Decimals: This feature permits the restriction of the displayed decimals. It operates at the UI level and does not affect validation rules or the storage of numbers in the database. Consequently, these options only apply to read-only mode.
When you choose to limit the number of decimals, the following choices will be available:
Number of Decimals: This denotes the count of decimals to be shown. It can range from 0 to 4.

In the case of the field being an action parameter, this record will correspond to the record where the action is being executed. parentField sys.data.Record This variable is only accessible when the field is situated within a nested field, and it is contingent on the source variable being either a record or an action (the same principles apply when it is an action parameter or an entity field).
It is a sys.data.Record object with the distinction that the root of the record is established as the nested fields containing it. This configuration enables you to access fields within the nested group using the syntax parentField.field('fieldA') instead of record.field('nested.fieldA') or action.field('nested.fieldA'). This distinction is particularly valuable when nested fields are multi-valued, as you are not required to ascertain the index. action sys.data.Action This variable will be accessible solely when the field functions as an action parameter.

Limit decimals # This feature enables the limitation of the number of decimals. This limitation will be applied at the data level, meaning numbers will be stored in the database with the specified number of decimals, and any additional decimals will be discarded. If you wish to retain the additional decimals for display purposes while limiting their storage, you should configure these settings within the display options.
When you opt to limit the number of decimals, the following choices will be presented:
Number of Decimals: This indicates the number of decimals to be stored. It can range from 0 to 4.
Extra Decimals Action: This specifies the action to take when there are more decimals than the limit permits. The available options include:
Round: Rounding will be used to limit the decimals. Truncate: Truncation will be applied to the trailing decimals. Throw Error: An error will be triggered if an attempt is made to set more decimals than the allowable limit. Display options # Show Thousands Separator: If this flag is enabled, the thousands separator will be displayed in read-only mode. Please note that this flag does not impact edit mode.
Limit Number of Decimals: This feature permits the restriction of the displayed decimals. It operates at the UI level and does not affect validation rules or the storage of numbers in the database. Consequently, these options only apply to read-only mode.
When you choose to limit the number of decimals, the following choices will be available:
Number of Decimals: This denotes the count of decimals to be shown. It can range from 0 to 4.
Extra Decimals Action: This specifies the action to be taken when there are more decimals than the set limit. The available options include:

For example, to query tasks with an attachment where the name is similar to 'logo.png'. We use 'like' because the name can include the file size, so using 'equals' might not yield the expected results:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds a task with attachment &#39;logo.png&#39; var records_sample = sys.data.find('tasks', {attachments: &#39;like(logo.png)&#39;}); log('total: '+records_sample.count()); while (records_sample.hasNext()) { log(records_sample.next().label()); } // finds a task with attachment &#39;logo.png&#39; var query_sample = sys.data.createQuery('tasks') .field(&#39;attachments&#39;).like(&#39;logo.png&#39;) var records_sample = sys.data.find(query_sample); log('total: '+records_sample.count()); while (records_sample.hasNext()) { log(records_sample.next().label()); } // finds a task with attachment &#39;logo.png&#39; GET /data/contacts?attachments=like(logo.png) You could also query by the ID:

This label can be employed throughout the application to display a preview of the nested fields or to facilitate searches across records.
There are three available options:
None: No label will be generated. In the user interface, an auto-generated label might appear based on the field&rsquo;s name and the index if it&rsquo;s a multi-valued field.
Field: A nested field can be chosen, and its value will be used as the label.
Script: A script can be utilized to generate the label:
Parameters # Name Type Description record sys.data.Record The record the field belongs to. nested sys.data.Record This is a sys.data.Record object, with the distinction that the root of the record is designated to the nested fields. To illustrate, consider the subsequent structure:
- name
- email
- addresses
- addressLine
- zipCode
- state
Suppose the field &ldquo;addresses&rdquo; is multi-valued, and you desire the label to be the &ldquo;state.&rdquo; In this situation, you cannot utilize the record variable since you aren&rsquo;t aware of which address you are generating the label for. The solution entails employing the nested variable, which inherently points to the address you are calculating the label for. This could be achieved as follows:
return nested.field(&lsquo;state&rsquo;).name(); Returns # string: You should return the label
Samples # // uses the state and zip code as the label return nested.field('state').val()+'-'+nested.field('zipCode').val(); Display options # Show as accordion # Enabling this option allows the group of fields to be collapsible and expandable, with the label serving as the title of the accordion.
Indent fields # Enabling this option causes the inner fields to be indented in the UI, aligning them to the right of the parent field&rsquo;s label.
If this option isn&rsquo;t enabled, the label of the parent field will be displayed at the top, and the inner fields will be rendered below without indentation.
Inner fields layout # This setting controls the layout of inner fields, which proves especially useful when space is limited. The available options are:
Automatic: Based on the view&rsquo;s context, either a fixed or dynamic layout will be selected. For example, the dynamic layout will be used in the grid view, while the fixed layout will be chosen in read-only views. Fixed: Labels are allocated a predetermined amount of space, with the remaining space reserved for the values of the inner fields. Dynamic: The space allotted for inner field labels and values adjusts based on the content in each column. Custom: In this scenario, you can specify the width assigned to inner field labels, while the remaining space is designated for the values. REST API # Read format # The data is represented in JSON format and comprises the following fields:
id: This serves as the identifier for the nested group, primarily intended for internal use. label: The label associated with the nested group. Inner fields: Each inner field is contained within the map structure. In the example provided below, the fields addressLine, zipCode, city, and state are considered inner fields. Here is a sample representation of a nested field in JSON format:
&quot;address&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5877e2bd41058800079d11cc&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;WV - 25335&quot;, &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;3351 Harper Center&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;25335&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Charleston&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;WV&quot; } Write format # You can set a nested field by providing it’s inner fields:
&quot;address&quot;: { &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;3351 Harper Center&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;25335&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Charleston&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;WV&quot; } When updating a multi-valued nested field, it is crucial to include the corresponding id:
&quot;addresses&quot;: [ { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd45aee4b0ce322b0c86ac&quot;, &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;4 Crownhardt Plaza&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;73157&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Oklahoma City&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;OK&quot; }, { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd45aee4b0ce322b0c86aa&quot;, &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;4 Magdeline Place&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;89145&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NV&quot; } ] If the id is not provided, the system will interpret the absence of the id as a request to delete the existing entry and add a new one, which will result in assigning a new ID to the entry.
Please note that you should refrain from sending the label, as it is automatically calculated and managed.
JavaScript API # Read format # The val() method within the wrapper will return an object:
{ &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;803 Anthes Pass&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;08608&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Trenton&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NJ&quot; } In essence, this represents an object with inner fields contained within.
However, rather than directly retrieving the raw value of the relationship in most instances, you will typically utilize the methods provided within the wrapper to directly access the ID or label.
Write format # When configuring nested fields, you should adhere to the same format as used for reading:
{ &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;803 Anthes Pass&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;08608&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Trenton&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NJ&quot; } For example:
contact.field('address').val({ &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;803 Anthes Pass&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;08608&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Trenton&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NJ&quot; }); If the field is multi-valued, you have the option to specify the index:
company.field('addresses[1]').val({ &quot;addressLine&quot;: &quot;803 Anthes Pass&quot;, &quot;zipCode&quot;: &quot;08608&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Trenton&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NJ&quot; }); For multi-valued fields, you can also leverage the utilities provided by sys.data.ManyWrapper.

JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // filters by state var records_sample = sys.data.find('contacts', {&#39;address.state&#39;: &#39;NY&#39;}); log('total: '+records_sample.count()); while (records_sample.hasNext()) { log(records_sample.next().label()); } // filters by state var query_sample = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') .field(&#39;address.state&#39;).equals(&#39;NY&#39;) var records_sample = sys.data.find(query_sample); log('total: '+records_sample.count()); while (records_sample.hasNext()) { log(records_sample.next().label()); } // filters by state GET /data/contacts?address.state=NY In these cases, you should employ the format and operators corresponding to the type of inner fields.
Furthermore, querying is feasible even when dealing with multi-valued nested fields:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // filters by state var records_sample2 = sys.data.find('companies', {&#39;addresses.state&#39;: &#39;NY&#39;}); log('total: '+records_sample2.count()); while (records_sample2.hasNext()) { log(records_sample2.next().label()); } // filters by state var query_sample2 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;addresses.state&#39;).equals(&#39;NY&#39;) var records_sample2 = sys.data.find(query_sample2); log('total: '+records_sample2.count()); while (records_sample2.hasNext()) { log(records_sample2.next().label()); } // filters by state GET /data/contacts?addresses.state=NY In this scenario, since &ldquo;addresses&rdquo; is multi-valued, any company that possesses at least one address with &ldquo;NY&rdquo; in the &ldquo;state&rdquo; field will be encompassed in the results.
Finally, for querying nested record fields simultaneously:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // filters by street and zip code var records_sample3 = sys.data.find('companies', {&#39;addresses&#39;: {&#39;street&#39;: &#39;Street 123&#39;, &#39;zipCode&#39;: &#39;1234&#39;}}); log('total: '+records_sample3.count()); while (records_sample3.hasNext()) { log(records_sample3.next().label()); } // filters by street and zip code var query_sample3 = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;addresses&#39;).equals({&#39;street&#39;: &#39;Street 123&#39;, &#39;zipCode&#39;: &#39;1234&#39;}) var records_sample3 = sys.data.find(query_sample3); log('total: '+records_sample3.count()); while (records_sample3.hasNext()) { log(records_sample3.next().label()); } // filters by street and zip code GET /data/contacts?addresses={same-as-query-builder} Aggregate queries # Please refer to the Aggregate Queries Documentation for more detailed information.

We refer to these applications as OAuth Apps.
Follow the steps below to acquire and refresh the Access Token.
In the Slingr app # 1) Enabling OAuth support in builder and creating scopes # Navigate to Security -&gt; OAuth and enable OAuth support. This action will activate a form for OAuth Scopes. OAuth tokens security is now managed through OAuth scope groups, rather than user groups.
Field Description Name This is the name of the OAuth Scope, which must be unique. Description Provide a human-readable description of the OAuth Scope. Ensure it is under 140 characters since OAuth app scopes are displayed on the authorization page. Groups Here, you can define the groups associated with the OAuth App. Security for OAuth tokens is regulated by these groups, instead of user groups. Before deleting a scope, verify if it&rsquo;s being used in any OAuth App. Remember to save your changes after making modifications.
2) Registering the OAuth app in the Slingr app # Once OAuth is enabled, head to the Runtime section. In the secondary menu, locate OAuth Apps.
Proceed to create an OAuth App with the following fields:
Field Description Label This is a user-friendly name for the OAuth App, displayed to users on the Authorization page. Name Enter the name of the OAuth App. Icon Upload an icon that will be presented to users on the authorization page. It should have dimensions of 64x64 px. If not provided, a default icon will be displayed. Description Include a description for the OAuth App. Authorization Callback URL After the authorization step, an authorization code will be appended to this URL and triggered. Scopes OAuth tokens security is regulated by groups defined in scopes. Client Id A randomly generated key assigned to identify the OAuth App in requests. In the OAuth app # 1) Prompt the user to log in and authorize the OAuth App. # Prompt the user to log in and authorize the OAuth App by opening the Authorize URL in a new window. The URL should include the response_type and client_id parameters.
https://&lt;appName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/authorize?response_type=code&amp;client_id=&lt;client_id&gt; In this URL:
appName refers to the app&rsquo;s name. env is the environment name (e.g., dev or prod). client_id should be the client id specified in the OAuth App. If an OAuth Authorization exists for the user and the OAuth App, a form requesting the user&rsquo;s authorization for the OAuth App will be displayed. If the OAuth authorization is revoked from the Slingr App, the authorization form will reappear.
After the user&rsquo;s authorization, a callback URL containing the authorization_code will be invoked from the Authorize page.
https://&lt;oAuthAppAuthorizationCallbackUrl&gt;?code=&lt;authorization_code&gt; In this URL:
oAuthAppAuthorizationCallbackUrl stands for the callback URL set in the OAuth App. authorization_code corresponds to the authorization code required for requesting the access token. It&rsquo;s expected that the endpoint executed by the callback URL will store the authorization code provided by the code parameter and subsequently close the authorization window.
2) Acquiring an Access Token with the Authorization Code # To obtain an access token, initiate a POST request to the slingr app&rsquo;s OAuth token endpoint.
POST https://&lt;appName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/api/oauth/token?grant_type=authorization_code&amp;client_id=&lt;client_id&gt;&amp;code=&lt;authorization_code&gt; In this URL:
appName is the app&rsquo;s name. env refers to the environment name (e.g., dev or prod). client_id corresponds to the client id established in the OAuth App. authorization_code should be replaced with the code obtained in step 1. If you encounter an expired authorization code while attempting to retrieve an access token, you will receive the following information:
{ &quot;access_token&quot;: &quot;5HMxY4eBEK2xvmkATMCzSdJ0wTxMlSlF&quot;, &quot;refresh_token&quot;: &quot;ZqUeuPwAezCZWpDQqjCW&quot;, &quot;token_type&quot;: &quot;bearer&quot;, &quot;expires_in&quot;: 28800, &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;scope1 scope2 scope3&quot; } Field Description Access Token The access token to be included in the Authorization header of your REST API requests. Refresh Token Use this token to refresh the Access Token in case a request to the REST API results in a 401 error. Token Type Indicates that the token type is bearer. Expires in Specifies the token&rsquo;s expiration time in seconds. Once expired, you can obtain a new token using the refresh token. Scope Provides information about the scopes defined for the OAuth App. 3) Put the access token in an authorization header in your requests # Example: To retrieve a list of companies, execute a GET request while including the Authorization header with the Bearer token, which is the access token you obtained. Below is a sample request:
GET https://&lt;appName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/api/data/companies &gt; Authorization: Bearer &lt;access_token&gt; In this request:
appName stands for the app&rsquo;s name. env represents the environment name, such as dev or prod. access_token should be replaced with the actual access token obtained in step 2. Upon successful authentication, this request will retrieve the desired list of companies from the API. More info about using the REST API
4) Refresh the token # Utilize the refresh token acquired in step 2 to initiate a request for a new access token. This enables you to obtain a new access token without requiring user involvement (as in step 1).
POST https://&lt;appName&gt;.slingrs.io/&lt;env&gt;/runtime/api/oauth/token?grant_type=refresh_token&amp;client_id=&lt;client_id&gt;&amp;code=&lt;refresh_token&gt; In this URL:
appName is the name of the app. env is the environment name (e.g., dev or prod). client_id corresponds to the client id established in the OAuth App. refresh_token is the refresh token obtained in step 2. This process will yield a new access token, allowing you to seamlessly continue API interactions.

Example: automatic calculation of slices # Use case # This type of graph allows data representation in such a way that you immediately understand that you are seeing parts of a whole. As an example you may need to view the number of articles summarized by content type.
Precondition # You need to have an entity that contains articles. Each article can be of a single Type and have a name.
As an example, the types of articles are: Sports, Culture, Technology, Society, Others.
Creating a pie chart with automatic calculation of slices # The following steps outline how to create this type of chart:
Step 1: To create the widget within the root layout of the given dashboard, either in columns or rows, navigate to Assign Widget. Step 2: You can either assign an existing widget or create a new one. In this case, we&rsquo;re creating a new widget. Step 3: Provide a label and name for the new widget, then select Pie Chart as the widget type and choose Automatic for Slices Calculation. Step 4: Under Automatic Slices Configuration, select the entity that contains the relevant data. Next, choose the Slice Group which, in this case, is the field called Type. Complete the label and name for the slice. Step 5: The slice type will be an Integer, as we&rsquo;re summarizing the count of records. Step 6: For this use case, the necessary operation is Count. Step 7: Save the changes and push them. Example: manual calculation of slices # Use case # This graph type enables the representation of data in a manner that immediately conveys parts of a whole. As an example, you might need to compare the number of articles categorized as Technology versus articles in other categories (Sports, Culture, Society, Others).
Prerequisite # You need to have an entity containing articles. Each article should have a single Type and a Name.
For instance, the article types could include: Sports, Culture, Technology, Society, Others.
Creating a pie chart with manual calculation of slices # The following steps illustrate the process:
Step 1: To begin, navigate to the root layout of the dashboard (either in columns or rows) and select Assign Widget. Step 2: You can assign an existing widget or create a new one. In this case, we&rsquo;ll create a new widget. Step 3: Provide a label and name for the new widget. Choose Pie Chart as the widget type and set Manual for Slices Calculation, then save it. Step 4: Under the Slices menu option within the view, click on Create. Step 5: Fill in the model settings, using the entity Content. Set a Label and a Name. Choose the Type as Integer. Step 6: After selecting the Type, set the Calculation Type as Aggregate. Apply a filter to consider only the records with the type Technology. For Operation, select Count. Step 7: In Slice Styling Settings, pick a color for the slice, and save the configuration. Step 8: Create a new slice by clicking on Create. Step 9: Fill in the model settings, using the entity Content. Set a Label and a Name. Choose the Type as Integer. Step 10: After selecting the Type, set the Calculation Type as Aggregate. Apply a filter to exclude records where the type is not Technology. For Operation, select Count. Step 11: In Slice Styling Settings, select a color for the slice, and save the configuration. Step 12: Save the changes and push them. UI message # Widgets can respond to UI messages. A common use case is when data needs refreshing or filters need applying.
Refresh and filter # You can send a message to refresh the widget with default settings. These messages are sent to the dashboard container and propagated to each widget.
Additionally, you can send a filter parameter to apply it to the query used for data retrieval. The query can be a query object or a query map. If using a query object, the filter is applied only when the entity matches that set in the widget. Refer to the Query Language for more information.
To apply filters, set the widgetContainer with a list of objects, each describing the container name and the filter to be applied to each widget. The title can also be sent to update the widget title.
Example # In the following example, you refresh and apply a filter by sending the filter parameter to the given widget container. Note how each series defines its own query and applies it to a specific entity.
var query = sys.data.createQuery('content'); query.field('access').equals('PUBLIC'); sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'view', name: 'refresh', views: ['dashboard'], widgetContainers: [ { name: 'col11', filter: [ { name: 'content', filter: query } ] } ] }); `}),e.add({id:205,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/field-types/text/qr/",title:"QR type",description:`Overview # This type stores text and displays it as a QR code in read-only view.

Filtering # A filter is utilized to specify which records can be referenced by this field. If a record fails to meet the filter&rsquo;s criteria, a validation error will be triggered.
It&rsquo;s important to note that the user interface (UI) will automatically filter out records that don&rsquo;t fulfill the specified criteria.
If another record is specified within displayed options, the filters will be combined so that both criteria are met.
Copied Fields # Due to certain restrictions inherent to the database functionality, there might be instances where it&rsquo;s necessary to not only store a reference to a record but also specific information from that record. For instance, let&rsquo;s consider an entity named &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; which has a relationship field pointing to another entity named &ldquo;companies&rdquo;. Within the &ldquo;companies&rdquo; entity, there&rsquo;s a field named &ldquo;type&rdquo;. Suppose you wish to perform a query to retrieve all contacts where the &ldquo;type&rdquo; field of the company they reference is &ldquo;a&rdquo;. To facilitate this type of query, you should designate &ldquo;type&rdquo; as a copied field from the relationship field pointing to &ldquo;company&rdquo;. This arrangement would allow you to execute a query like the following (assuming &ldquo;company&rdquo; is the name of the relationship field):
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // filter contacts by company type var records_sample = sys.data.find('companies', {&#39;company.type&#39;: &#39;a&#39;}); log('total: '+records_sample.count()); while (records_sample.hasNext()) { log(records_sample.next().label()); } // filter contacts by company type var query_sample = sys.data.createQuery('companies') .field(&#39;company.type&#39;).equals(&#39;a&#39;) var records_sample = sys.data.find(query_sample); log('total: '+records_sample.count()); while (records_sample.hasNext()) { log(records_sample.next().label()); } // filter contacts by company type GET /data/contacts?company.type=a Once a field is designated as a copied field, it becomes available for use in various contexts. For instance, when you&rsquo;re defining permissions for the &ldquo;contacts&rdquo; entity, you can utilize the &ldquo;company.type&rdquo; field to filter accessible records.
It&rsquo;s important to note that you don&rsquo;t always need to add copied fields when creating expressions based on fields in related records. For instance, if you&rsquo;re creating an expression to highlight records in a grid view, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to copy fields. For instance, if you want to highlight all contacts where the &ldquo;type&rdquo; is &ldquo;b,&rdquo; you wouldn&rsquo;t need to make the &ldquo;type&rdquo; field a copied field.
The guiding principle is that copied fields are required when queries are involved, whether initiated by you or internally by the application. If a query isn&rsquo;t necessary, then copying the field is unnecessary. In the app builder, you&rsquo;ll notice that while in some cases you can select any field from related records, in other cases, you can only select copied fields.
Understanding the Overhead and Behavior of Copied Fields:
In the provided example, the &ldquo;type&rdquo; field will be copied from the &ldquo;company&rdquo; record to the &ldquo;contact&rdquo; record. Consequently, if you edit the &ldquo;company&rdquo; and update the &ldquo;type&rdquo; field, the new value will automatically propagate to contacts that were referencing this company. This cascade update takes place asynchronously in the background, which means that depending on the number of records that need updating, there could be a noticeable delay in this process.
It&rsquo;s worth noting that introducing numerous copied fields can potentially have adverse effects on an application&rsquo;s performance. Therefore, it&rsquo;s advisable to employ them only when no alternative solution exists for a given problem.
Lastly, you have the ability to modify the default propagation behavior through the &ldquo;Copied Fields Update Policy&rdquo; option.
It's advisable that copied fields do not undergo frequent value changes, as this can help prevent potential performance concerns. Moreover, if alterations to a copied field tend to trigger a substantial number of updates, it's worth exploring alternatives to utilizing copied fields. Delete policy # This indicates the action to take when the record referenced by the field is deleted. The available options are:
None: This is the default behavior. No action will be taken, and the field will continue to point to the deleted record, resulting in a broken relationship. An attempt to save the record will trigger a validation error. Remove Relationship: The field&rsquo;s value will be set to null, and if it&rsquo;s a multi-valued field, it will be removed from the list. Delete Record: The record that references the deleted record will also be deleted. This can be particularly useful for master-detail relationships, where associated records are meant to be deleted when the master record is deleted. Label update policy # By default, if the label of a record changes and there are other records referencing it, a job will be initiated to update the label on those records, similar to the behavior of copied fields.
It&rsquo;s crucial to ensure that labels are updated accurately for correct user display in the UI and for queries that filter by the relationship field using record labels.
However, updating the label in all fields that reference the modified record incurs a performance penalty. To manage this behavior, there are options:
Yes: The field&rsquo;s value will be automatically updated when the label of the record changes. No: The field&rsquo;s value won&rsquo;t be updated if the label of the record changes. In this scenario, there might be a discrepancy between the label displayed in the field and the actual label in the referenced record. To mitigate performance concerns, strive to keep labels as stable as possible to minimize frequent changes that trigger numerous cascade updates.
Copied fields update policy # This policy allows you to specify whether copied fields should be automatically updated when their values change. The available options are:
Yes: If the value of any copied field changes in the referenced record, the corresponding values in the relationship field will be updated. No: If the value of any copied field changes in the referenced record, the values in the relationship field won&rsquo;t be updated. This could lead to inconsistent query results when using those copied fields. Display options # Representation # Determines how the value will be displayed:
Drop down: A dropdown menu will be employed for selecting the field&rsquo;s value. Boxes: All records eligible as the field&rsquo;s value will be presented in individual boxes, enabling users to easily select one. It&rsquo;s advisable to use this representation when the number of available options is limited. Note that this representation supports a maximum of 100 records. In both cases, these representations are applicable only in edit mode.
Filtering # A filter is employed to specify which records can be referenced by this field. Unlike the filtering option available in type rules, this filter operates solely at the UI level and will not trigger validation errors.
This option proves beneficial when you intend to narrow down the records that can be selected for a specific view.
Enable Link # Enabling this flag results in the rendering of a link to the reference record in read-only mode.
Please note that you must select a view in which the referenced record can be displayed.
Allow creating new records # When enabled, this flag adds a button in edit mode that allows the creation of a new record. If the record is created using this button, it will be automatically selected as the value for the field.
Keep in mind that you need to select a view to use for creating the new record.
Allow editing records # Enabling this flag displays a button in edit mode that permits the editing of the referenced record.
Please note that you must select a view in which the referenced record can be edited.
Sort field # This allows the possible records to be sorted by a specific field.
Sort type # Specifies the sort direction, which can be ascending or descending.
Visible fields # If you require displaying more information from the referenced record beyond just the label, you can employ visible fields. These fields will be showcased in the read-only view of the field alongside the record&rsquo;s label.
It&rsquo;s important to understand that these visible fields are not stored in the database, which distinguishes them from copied fields. Instead, they are dynamically merged at the time of reading the record.
Visible fields layout # This option provides control over the layout of visible fields, particularly useful when space is limited. The available options are:
Automatic: The layout is chosen based on the view&rsquo;s context. For example, the dynamic layout is applied in grid views, while read-only views adopt the fixed layout. Fixed: Labels are allocated a predetermined space, with the remaining space designated for visible field values. Dynamic: Space allocated for both labels and values of visible fields adjusts according to the content in each column. Custom: In this scenario, you can specify the width allocated for visible field labels, while the remaining space is designated for values. Allow label wrapping # Set this to true when labels of relationship fields are notably lengthy, and you wish to wrap the context by adding ellipsis. This should be applied only when displaying the field using the label class, similar to visible fields. The default value is false.
REST API # Read format # The data is represented in JSON format and includes the following fields:
id: This signifies the ID of the referenced record. label: This represents the label of the referenced record. Copied fields: Any copied fields are contained within the map structure. In the example provided below, the fields type and isCustomer are copied fields. Here is a sample representation of a relationship field in JSON format:
&quot;company&quot;: { &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c55af&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Fivechat&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;c&quot;, &quot;isCustomer&quot;: false } Write format # You have several options for the write format:
You can provide only the ID:
&quot;company&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c55af&quot;} Alternatively, you can directly pass the ID as a string:
&quot;company&quot;: &quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c55af&quot; You can supply the label of the record:
&quot;company&quot;: {&quot;label&quot;: &quot;Fivechat&quot;} Or provide the label as a string:
&quot;company&quot;: &quot;Fivechat&quot; When utilizing the label, it&rsquo;s imperative that each label is unique. If multiple records share the same label, attempting to save the records will result in a validation error.
Furthermore, it&rsquo;s possible to employ a lookup field. For instance, if the field &quot;code&quot; in the &quot;companies&quot; entity has been designated as a lookup field, you can utilize the following approach:
&quot;company&quot;: {&quot;code&quot;: &quot;fivechat-co&quot;} Or provide the code field value as a string:
&quot;company&quot;: &quot;fivechat-co&quot; JavaScript API # Read format # The val() method within the wrapper will return an object:
{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c55af&quot;, &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Fivechat&quot;, &quot;link&quot;: &quot;/data/companies/57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c55af&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;c&quot;, &quot;isCustomer&quot;: false } Where:
id: This is the ID of the referenced record. label: This represents the label of the referenced record. link: This is the URL in the REST API for the record. Copied fields: Any copied fields are included within the map structure. In the example provided below, the fields type and isCustomer are copied fields. However, in most cases, rather than retrieving the raw value of the relationship, you will use the methods available in the wrapper to directly access the ID or label.
Write format # You have several options for the write format of the Javascript API:
You can provide only the ID:
record.field(&quot;company&quot;).val({id: &quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c55af&quot;}); Alternatively, you can directly pass the ID as a string:
record.field(&quot;company&quot;).val(&quot;57fd2d61e4b0ce322b0c55af&quot;); You can supply the label of the record:
record.field(&quot;company&quot;).val({label: &quot;Fivechat&quot;}); Or provide the label as a string:
record.field(&quot;company&quot;).val(&quot;Fivechat&quot;); When utilizing the label, it&rsquo;s imperative that each label is unique. If multiple records share the same label, attempting to save the records will result in a validation error.
Furthermore, it&rsquo;s possible to employ a lookup field. For instance, if the field &quot;code&quot; in the &quot;companies&quot; entity has been designated as a lookup field, you can utilize the following approach:
record.field(&quot;company&quot;).val({code: &quot;fivechat-co&quot;}); Or provide the code field value as a string:
record.field(&quot;company&quot;).val(&quot;fivechat-co&quot;); If you include all the fields, the priority order for determining the value is as follows: id takes precedence, followed by label, and finally any configured lookup field.
The JavaScript API also provides the option to establish a relationship wrapper as demonstrated below:
contact1.field('company').val(contact2.field('company')); Or provide a record object:
var company = sys.data.findOne('companies', {name: 'Browsetype'}); contact.field('company').val(company); Wrapper method: id() # Returns the ID of the referenced record or null if the field is empty.
Returns # string - The ID of the referenced record.
Samples # // prints the ID of the referenced record in a relationship field var record = sys.data.findOne('contacts', {email: 'djohnstonb0@behance.net'}); log('company id: '+record.field('company').id()); Wrapper method: label() # Returns the label of the referenced record or null if the field is empty.
Returns # string - The label of the referenced record
Samples # // prints the label of the referenced record in a relationship field var record = sys.data.findOne('contacts', {email: 'djohnstonb0@behance.net'}); log('company label: '+record.field('company').label()); Wrapper method: fetch(fields) # Returns the referenced record. If the record cannot be found, it will return null. Optionally, you can specify the fields to be retrieved.
Parameters # Name Type Required Description fields string[] yes An array of fields to be retrieved Returns # sys.data.Record - The label of the referenced record.

&quot;relationshipField&quot;,&quot;relationshipField.type&quot; &quot;Record label&quot;,&quot;a&quot; Notice that it is possible to export fields from the related record.
Import format # There are different ways to import relationship fields. One of the simplest methods is to use the label:
&quot;relationshipField&quot; &quot;Record label&quot; Additionally, it is possible to indicate a lookup field:
&quot;relationshipField.lookupField&quot; &quot;abc-123&quot; In this case, the related record will be matched using the specified lookup field. An error will be thrown if more than one record is matched.
Lastly, please be aware that if you provide the related fields, the record could be automatically created or updated:
&quot;relationshipField.code&quot;,&quot;relationshipField.name&quot; &quot;abc-123&quot;,&quot;test&quot; For example, this will create a new record with fields &quot;code&quot; and &quot;name&quot; set to &quot;abc-123&quot; and &quot;test&quot; respectively. If one of those fields is marked as unique, the import process will first attempt to match an existing record. If a match is found, the record will be updated; if not, a new record will be created.

For instance, the following query will retrieve contacts where the label of the company is &lsquo;Blogpad&rsquo;:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds a contact by company label var records_sample2 = sys.data.find('contacts', {company: &#39;Blogpad&#39;}); log('total: '+records_sample2.count()); while (records_sample2.hasNext()) { log(records_sample2.next().label()); } // finds a contact by company label var query_sample2 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') .field(&#39;company&#39;).equals(&#39;Blogpad&#39;) var records_sample2 = sys.data.find(query_sample2); log('total: '+records_sample2.count()); while (records_sample2.hasNext()) { log(records_sample2.next().label()); } // finds a contact by company label GET /data/contacts?company=Blogpad However you can also use the label explicitly:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds a contact by company label var records_sample3 = sys.data.find('contacts', {&#39;company.label&#39;: &#39;Blogpad&#39;}); log('total: '+records_sample3.count()); while (records_sample3.hasNext()) { log(records_sample3.next().label()); } // finds a contact by company label var query_sample3 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') .field(&#39;company&#39;).equals(&#39;Blogpad&#39;) var records_sample3 = sys.data.find(query_sample3); log('total: '+records_sample3.count()); while (records_sample3.hasNext()) { log(records_sample3.next().label()); } // finds a contact by company label GET /data/contacts?company.label=Blogpad Note that you don&rsquo;t need to explicitly include &ldquo;label&rdquo; in the query builder path. It is automatically identified based on what you provide to the equals method.
You can also perform a query based on the ID:
JS Query MapJS Query BuilderREST API // finds a company by exact name var records_sample4 = sys.data.find('contacts', {&#39;company.id&#39;: &#39;57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8565&#39;}); log('total: '+records_sample4.count()); while (records_sample4.hasNext()) { log(records_sample4.next().label()); } // finds a company by exact name var query_sample4 = sys.data.createQuery('contacts') .field(&#39;company&#39;).equals(&#39;57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8565&#39;) var records_sample4 = sys.data.find(query_sample4); log('total: '+records_sample4.count()); while (records_sample4.hasNext()) { log(records_sample4.next().label()); } // finds a company by exact name GET /data/contacts?company.id=57fd2d65e4b0ce322b0c8565 Again, the query builder will automatically recognize the ID, so you don&rsquo;t need to use the &ldquo;id&rdquo; suffix in this case.
Remember that when utilizing the query builder, you have the flexibility to use any of the formats available in the JavaScript API.

Pagination # Enable pagination # This option determines whether pagination is displayed on the widget.
Page size # This defines the number of rows that a page can contain. This option is only available when Enable Pagination is set to true.
Columns # Here, you can add or remove fields as columns in the table listing. These columns will use the default display options of fields, but you can override them. For more information, consult the General Display Options documentation.
Columns have additional options beyond those available for fields:
Automatic Width: Indicates whether the browser should automatically adjust the width of the column based on the available space and content or if it should have a fixed width, which can be specified in pixels or as a percentage. Allow to Wrap Title: By default, the title won&rsquo;t wrap unless this flag is enabled. This can be useful for fields with long labels (you can also override the label of the field in the display options). Allow Sorting: This flag indicates whether sorting arrows will be available on this column. This flag is set by default for fields with the indexable flag set. Available events # On row clicked # This event is fired every time you click on a table row. It is listened to by all the defined layout listeners that belong to the Dashboard. The event type name is TABLE_ROW_CLICKED, and the event payload contains the recordId.
UI message # Widgets can react to UI messages, commonly used for refreshing data or applying filters.
Refresh and filter # You can send a message to refresh the widget using its default settings. These messages are sent to the dashboard container and propagated to each widget.
Additionally, you can send a filter parameter to be applied to the query used to fetch the data. This query can be a query object or a query map. For query objects, the filter is only applied if the entity matches the entity set in the widget. Refer to the Query Language for more information.
To apply filters, set the widgetContainer with a list of objects, each describing the container&rsquo;s name and the filter to be applied on each widget. You can also include the title to update the widget title.
Example # Use case # Table widgets allow for a more condensed view of specific collection information. The configuration process is similar to grid views. Tables are useful for comparing pairs of related values, such as quarterly sales over multiple years. They are also suitable for situations where you have multiple sets of values with a direct relationship.
For instance, consider a scenario where you want to visualize the relationship between costs and generated income. A table could be ideal for presenting such information.
Precondition # For this example, we assume that there is an existing grid view containing a read-only view for the Companies entity. The grid view is named companies, and several records are present.
Creating a table widget # Step 1: You can create a widget from the root layout of a Dashboard, or from a column or row within a Dashboard view. Alternatively, you can create it from the Widget views menu and then associate it with a Dashboard view.
Step 2: On the widget view creation screen, load the required data and select Table as the Widget type. Choose the Companies entity. Once all fields are completed, click Create.
Step 3: In the table widget&rsquo;s column editing screen, create three columns referencing the name, costs, and revenue fields.
Step 4: Associate the new widget with an existing Dashboard.
Step 5: Add a listener to the Dashboard to react to the TABLE_ROW_CLICKED event type. Send a UI message to navigate to the corresponding read-only view.
Step 6: Provide the necessary context for the On event script and the script that responds to the event by sending a UI message.
Parameters # Name Type Description event object This event object contains information about where was the refresh fired, it can be when user click the refresh button of the UI or when send UI messages from other side. Samples # // React to a table widget row clicked event // event payload contains all the specific event information var eventPayload = event.payload; if (eventPayload) { // reacting to the event 'TABLE_ROW_CLICKED' if (eventPayload.eventName == 'TABLE_ROW_CLICKED') { sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'global', name: 'navigate', view: 'projects', target: 'caller', recordId: eventPayload.recordId }); } } Step 6: Push changes, and when you click on a row inside the table widget, you will navigate to the corresponding read-only view.
Events and UI Messages # Here&rsquo;s an example that demonstrates how to react to a table widget row event. We will need to monitor events in a dashboard container.
Assuming you have a table widget hosted in the dashboard container salesCompaniesContainer, the following example checks if an event was fired from that specific table widget. This information is then used to create a new query to refresh a bar chart displaying sales per company.
Suppose you have a widget that displays sales per company, hosted in a dashboard container called salesPerCompaniesBar.
if(event.type == 'TABLE_ROW_CLICKED' &amp;&amp; event.containerName == 'salesCompaniesContainer') { var record = sys.data.findById('companies', event.recordId); var companyNameStr = record.field('name').val(); var query = sys.data.createQuery('salesPerCompany'); query.field('companyName').equals(companyNameStr); // query.field('period').greaterThan('...'); define some criteria for our query sys.ui.sendMessage({ scope: 'view', name: 'refresh', views: ['dashboardView'], widgetContainers: [ { name: 'salesPerCompaniesBar', title: 'Sales for - ' + companyNameStr, filter: query } ] }); } `}),e.add({id:211,href:"/slingrDoc/dev-reference/field-types/text/text/",title:"Text type",description:`Overview # This type can store free text of up to 300 characters.

Maximum length # Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed for field values.
Exact length # Requires that the value consists of a specific number of characters.
Regular expression # If set, you can use a regular expression to validate the value of the field. The expression should adhere to Java&rsquo;s regular expression syntax.
The following options are available:
Expression: This field allows you to enter the regular expression for value validation. Hint: In the event of a validation error, you can provide a user-friendly message here to assist users. Case Insensitive: If enabled, matching will be case insensitive. It&rsquo;s important to note that this only applies to simple characters in the expression. For instance, [a-z] will still require the letter to be lowercase, even if this flag is set. However, if you use &ldquo;ab&rdquo; in the expression, variations like &ldquo;Ab&rdquo; or &ldquo;AB&rdquo; will work. Display options # Representation # Determines how the field should be displayed, primarily impacting the edit view. The available options are:
Input Box: Displays a single-line input box. Text Area: Displays a text area. An additional option lets you specify the number of rows for the text area. Limit number of characters # This restricts the number of characters displayed, accompanied by a &ldquo;More&rdquo; button to expand the content. This option exclusively affects read-only fields.
Background color # Defines whether the text value should appear as a label in the read-only view. By default, this value is null, resulting in the value being displayed without a label. You have the ability to establish multiple conditional background color rules. For each rule, you must select a color and define an expression. All fields matching the expression will adopt the chosen color. Alternatively, you can use a script in place of an expression. The script can make use of the following parameters:
record: Represents the current record that the field is a part of. parentField: Applicable when the field is an inner field of a nested field type. This parameter enables referencing sibling fields. action: Applicable when the field is a parameter of an action. It&rsquo;s important to note that this option comes into play only when the field is in read-only mode.

There are several predefined formats available, which are commonly used. Additionally, you can choose the &quot;Custom&quot; option to define your own format based on the following guidelines:
Era designator: G (AD) Year: yy (16), yyyy (2016) Month: MMMM (July), MMM (Jul), MM (07) REST API # Read format # The format for the date is a string using the yyyy-MM format.
&quot;nextHolidays&quot;: &quot;2016-07&quot; Write format # To specify the date, you need to provide a string in the yyyy-MM format.

Write format # When writing the value, you have the option to either use a Date object or provide a string in the yyyy-MM format.
record.field('nextHolidays').val(new Date()); record.field('nextHolidays').val('2016-07'); If the provided value is not valid, the field will be silently set to null.

Welcome back! In this section, let's take a first look at the app we've been working on. Although it's currently a very basic setup, we'll keep working on it to enhance its features.

### Runtime Tasks grid view

👉 If you followed the previous instructions correctly, your view should look similar to this:

### Create a task

👉 In the top-right corner of the view, you'll find a **`Create`** button. Click on it, complete the form, and hit Create to see a read-only view of your new task:

👉 To go back to the table, you can either click on the element in the sidebar or use the **`All Tasks`** link located at the top-left corner of the view:

### Runtime Tasks actions and filters

👉 By default, this view allows you to **`create`** new tasks, **`view`** and **`edit`** existing ones, and **`delete`** them.

👉 You can also filter tasks using the listing headers, as well as export and import records. All of this was automatically generated from your app definition. Pretty awesome, right?

### Next step

I understand that our app is still very basic, but in the next section, we'll add some actions to our entity, allowing us to change the status of a task without having to go inside the edit view. For now, let's go to the builder tab or open it through the developer portal. [See you in the next section](/getting-started/getting/first-steps/task-mananger/adding/)!

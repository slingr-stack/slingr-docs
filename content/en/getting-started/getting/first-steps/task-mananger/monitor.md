Here's the improved version of the text:

We have completed the development of our app, but it's important to mention that you can monitor its activity using the app monitor. To access the monitor, click on the `Monitor` button (the one with an eye) on the developer portal.

On the app monitor, you can view information about your running apps. For example, you can see the logs of your app in the `Logs` section:

The app monitor is a valuable tool, and we encourage you to explore its different features. We hope you've learned a lot about Slingr during this tutorial. Now it's your turn to build something great!

Apps can be managed in the [Slingr Developer Portal](https://developer-portal.slingr.io).
From there, you will be able to manage apps, endpoints, organizations, handle developer permissions,
set up billing, and view invoices, etc.

## **App Creation**

ðŸ‘‰ To create a new app, simply click the **`Create app from scratch`** button located in the **`Home`** section of Slingr.

![Create new app from Home](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/home_create_new_app.png)

ðŸ‘‰ You can also create new apps from the **`Apps`** section by clicking the **`+ Create Apps`** button

![Create new app from Apps](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/apps_create_new_app.png)

Then, you will be asked to complete the following fields:

- **`Label`**: This is a human-friendly name for your app. It can contain spaces and special characters.
  The label will be used in your app in different places, like the header or the title of the browser.

- **`Name`**: This is the internal name of your app. It's required and cannot contain spaces or special characters,
  and it must be unique. It will be used as the subdomain of your app: **`<app-name>.slingrs.io`**.

{{< notes type="important" >}}
 You won't be able to change the <b>name</b> of your app later.
{{< /notes >}}

- **`App owner`**: You can choose to be the owner of the app or select an organization that you belong to.
- **`Plan`**: This is the plan your app will run on. You can choose between three different plans depending on your needs:
  - **`Slingr Personal Plan`**: This plan has a free 15-day trial period and is useful to understand the platform and learn how to use it, however, it is not suited for complex or production apps.
  - **`Slingr Professional Plan`**: This is an isolated environment with a fixed price that allows developers to have personal apps for a reasonable price. It has some limitations.
  - **`Slingr Business Plan`**: Here you can start to have an isolated production environment with a fixed price, it gives greater possibilities than the previous plans.
  - **`Slingr Enterprise Plan`**: This is a usage-based plan meant for applications in production environments that need dedicated resources and outstanding performance. There are no limitations with the **Slingr Enterprise Plan**.

  You can see the full comparison in [Pricing and Billing](https://www.slingr.io/platform/pricing).

- **`Template`**: You can choose to start from scratch, with an empty app, or you can choose one of the available templates. Here you will find global templates created by other people, or you can also create your own templates. See [App templates](#app-templates) for more information.

  ![Choose template](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/create_app_templates.png)

  When you select a template, you might decide to make it linked by setting the flag **`Linked`**, which
  is only available if you select **`Slingr Enterprise Plan`** as the plan.
- If this flag is set, the new app will be
  linked to the template. This means that the new app will only have a production environment, and when changes are synced in the template app, those changes will be applied to this new app as well.
  If you don't set this flag, only a development environment will be created using the app template. However, it will be completely independent of the original app, which means new changes in the template won't affect the new app, and vice versa.

By default, when you create a new app, only the development environment (unless you have set the **`Linked`** flag) is created with the selected plan.

{{< notes type="tip" >}}
You can add a production environment later or change the plan if needed.
{{< /notes >}}

Additionally, your developer account will be set as the admin, owner, and developer for the new app.

---

## **App settings**

Once an app is created, you will see the following options:

- **`Label`**: This is a user-friendly name of your app that was provided during the creation process. You
  can change the app's label at any time.

- **`Description`**: This is an internal description of your app. This field is for internal use or,
  if the app is a template, it will be used as the template's description.

- **`App logos`**: These are the logos, favicon, and background of the app. They will be displayed in different places, such as the **`Developer portal`**, your app's header, the browser's title, etc. We recommend using a transparent background, but you are free to choose any.

![App logos](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_details_logos.png)

Any changes you make to these settings will be applied immediately.

---

## **App Environment Settings**

Apps can have three different environments:

- **`Development`**: This is the main environment that developers will use to make their changes. It's the **default environment**.

- **`Staging`**: This environment can be used as a buffer between development and production. Additionally,
  when you are in production, and you need to fix something, this environment is ideal to apply
  hotfixes in **`Production`** without syncing all the changes in **`Development`**.

- **`Production`**: This is the production environment your users will access. This environment does
  not have the builder component because you should never change your app directly in production.

ðŸ‘‰ By default, a new app will only have the **`Development`** environment, but you can easily add new ones as
you need them.

ðŸ‘‰ Each app environment has the following settings:

![App environment details](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_environment_details_1.png)

- **`Status`**: This card shows the current runtime health and lifecycle of the environment. It now displays:
  - Deployment status (as it does today). If the value is different than **`Deployed`**, it could be that some maintenance work is going on (for example, the platform is being upgraded) or there is a problem and you should contact support.
  - Sleep status: one of **`awake`**, **`putting to sleep`**, **`sleeping`**, or **`waking up`**.
  - Auto-sleep policy enabled: **`True`**/**`False`**.

- **`Version`**: This is the current version your app is running on. We periodically release new updates
  to the platform, and we automatically update apps when that's possible. You can set the upgrade strategy for your apps.
  See [Upgrade Strategy](#upgrade-strategy) for more information.

- **`Instances`**: This is the number of runtime instances for this environment. The more instances you
  have, the more requests and work your environment can handle, so this is a good way to scale your
  app. Keep in mind that more instances also mean more usage, so be sure you understand how [Pricing
  and Billing]({{site.baseurl}}/platform-pricing-and-billing.html) work in your plan.
  It could be that not all instances are available at all times, for example, when you just added them,
  or there is some maintenance work. In that case, it will be shown how many instances are deployed
  and running out of the desired number of instances.
  Apart from the number of instances, you can also configure the size of each instance. You will
  need bigger instances as your app gets more complex. Don't worry; we will notify you if your instances are running out of resources. Here you should consider upgrading the size of your instance.
  The available sizes are:
  - **`Small (1GB)`**: This is the default size for apps. It is meant for small apps.
  - **`Medium (2GB)`**: This is for medium apps.
  - **`Large (4GB)`**: This is for big apps when there are many entities, views, listeners,
    endpoints, etc.

![App environment details](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_environment_details_2.png)

- **`Database`**: Just adding more instances might not work to scale your app as there is a point where
  the database will be the bottleneck. When you reach that point (usually we try to size the database
  based on data size, so you know when to switch), you should update the database of the app environment
  from here. Please take a look at [Pricing and Billing]({{site.baseurl}}/platform-pricing-and-billing.html)
  to understand how this will impact your invoice.

- **`Custom domain`**: By default, your app will be available at **`<appname>.slingrs.io`**; however,
  you can use your domain as well, for example, **`myapp.com`**. To do that, you need to
  own the domain and have a valid SSL certificate. Just click on **`Set your domain`**, and you will
  be asked to enter the domain and SSL certificate information. Upon creation you will be provided with an external IP to be configured on your domain provider.

### Manage environment sleep status

In order to optimize the usage of cluster resources, app admins can manage the sleep status of each environment from the **Status** card through the **`Manage status`** link.

When you click this link, a modal opens. Its options depend on the current sleep status of the environment:

- Status: **`awake`**
  - Auto-sleep: **`True`**/**`False`** (toggle). Disabled by default. If enabled, the environment will be put to sleep after reaching a certain threshold of inactivity (5 days exactly). Activity refers to user logins.

- Status: **`putting to sleep`**
  - The **`Manage status`** link is not available while the environment is transitioning.

- Status: **`sleeping`**
  - A button to wake up the environment is available.

- Status: **`waking up`**
  - The **`Manage status`** link is not available while the environment is transitioning.


![Enable auto sleep modal](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_enable_auto_sleep_modal.png)

There are a few cases that need changes in settings that deserve more attention:

### Scaling Up and Down Your App

The way to scale your app is by adding more instances. How many instances you need depends on your
app and the load it has, so it is hard to say how many users or API requests an instance can handle.

What we recommend is to watch out for the response time of your app and add more instances when you see
it goes above your maximum desired value or when you see that the waiting time of background jobs
is growing. You can check those things in the app monitor.

Also, keep in mind that adding more instances might not help if the database is the bottleneck. In
this case, you should upgrade your database to take advantage of the additional instances. You can
check the [slow queries]({{<ref "/dev-reference/monitoring/database-and-files.md">}})
report in the app monitor to see if the database is the bottleneck.

The same way you can add instances, you can remove them. When you do that, some instances will be
gracefully stopped and undeployed until the desired number of instances is met.

### Changing the Database

{{< notes type="warning">}}
Depending on the source and the target database type, changing the database could cause a downtime of your app.
{{< /notes >}}

If you are upgrading from a shared database to another shared database, in most cases, it won't mean
any downtime, and the data size limit will be updated immediately. If it happens that we need to do
some migrations, we will notify you, and you should confirm before proceeding.

If you are upgrading from a database in shared servers to one in dedicated servers, a migration will
be needed, and your app will be down during that time.

If you are upgrading from a database in dedicated servers to another database in dedicated servers,
migration can be done without any downtime.

Keep in mind that you will only be able to downgrade your database if the data size fits in the
new database type.

---

## **Manage Developers and Admins**

When you create an app, you automatically become the admin owner and a developer for it. However,
you can add permissions to other developers to work in your app or give them admin permissions.

### Developers

![App developers](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_settings_developers.png)
![App developers](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_settings_add_developer.png)

In the **`Developers`** section of the app details, you can add more developers by entering the email associated with their developer accounts. Once you add a developer, you can choose which environments they will have access to.

When you give access to one environment, the developer will be able to use all components in it, such as runtime, builder, and monitor. Additionally, a user will be created in the environment for that developer. So, if you go to the screen to manage users in that environment, you will see the developer listed as a user. These users will belong to the **`Developers`** group and cannot be modified (you can only assign new groups, but cannot change the password, name, etc.). They will be automatically managed and synced. For example, if the developer changes their password, it will be updated in all apps.

One important thing about developer users is that permissions defined in the app wonâ€™t affect developers as they always have permissions for everything. The exception is when you assign groups to the developer in that app. If you do so, the developer user will use those groupsâ€™ permissions by default.

If you need to test permissions while developing your app, you should create other regular users, assign groups to your developer user in that app, or use the **`"Switch groups"`** option available in the user menu of the app runtime.

### Admins

![App admins](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_settings_admins.png)
![App admins](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_settings_add_admin.png)

{{< notes type="note">}}
Admins are not allowed to use the app. If you want to, the admin should also be a developer.
{{< /notes >}}

ðŸ‘‰ In the **`Admins`** section of the app details, you can indicate which developer accounts will
have admin permissions over the app.

ðŸ‘‰ Admins can perform the following actions:

- Add/remove developers
- Change general settings of the app
- Change settings of the app environment

ðŸ‘‰ Furthermore, there is only one admin who is also the owner of the app (by default, the creator of the app).
The owner can perform the following actions:

- Add/remove admins
- Transfer ownership to another admin
- Put the app to sleep or wake it up
- Delete the app

ðŸ‘‰ Ownership can be transferred by adding a new admin and then, after selecting that admin, clicking on
the button **`Transfer ownership to this admin`**.

---

## **Sleeping and Wake Up**

If your app is not going to be used for a period, you can put it to **Sleep**. This way you can avoid charges while still
keeping your app. Later, if you need it again, you can wake it up and continue using it as usual.

This can be done by clicking the buttons **`Sleep app`** and **`Wake up app`**.

![Sleep app](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/sleep_app.png)
![Wake up app](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/wakeup_app.png)

{{< notes type="note">}}
This action can only be performed by the app owner.
{{< /notes >}}

---

## **Adding New Environments**

When an app is created, by default, it only has a `Development` environment. We recommend keeping only
the development environment until you see the need for another environment.

### Production Environment

![Add prod environment](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_add_production_env.png)

If you need a **`Production`** environment, you can easily add it by clicking the **`Add production environment`** button.

When you add a production environment, it will be created based on your current development
environment. However, keep in mind that **data won't be copied**. You should export and import records
from **`Development`** to **`Production`** if you need to do so.

Also, if you want developers to access the production environment, you will need to explicitly set
permissions, even if they already had permissions for the development environment.

### Staging Environment

![Add staging environment](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_add_staging_env.png)

Once you have a development and a production environment, you might see the need for an additional
environment to work as a buffer between development and production. This is the **`Staging`** environment,
and you can add it by clicking the **`Add staging environment`** button.

This environment is very useful for doing QA and also for performing hotfixes of issues that show up in
production.

---

## **Unlink app**

If you created the app from a template with the **`Linked`** flag, the app will only have a production
environment, and you won't be able to make changes. Instead, changes are made in the template app and
synced to the clones.

![Unlink app](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/unlink_app.png)

If, at some point, you need to make changes to the app, you will need to unlink the app first. You can
do that by clicking on the **`Unlink`** button in the app's details. When the app is unlinked, a
**`Development`** environment is added to the app.

{{< notes type="important" >}}
You won't be able to link it again to the template, and the apps will become independent of each other.
{{< /notes >}}

### Development environment in linked apps

There are cases where you need to make some changes to a linked app, but you don't want to unlink
it because you still want to get updates from the master app.

![Add development environment](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/add_development_env.png)

In these cases, you can add a development environment by clicking on **`Add development environment`**.
When you do this, how changes are synced will be altered. Please check the section
[Pushing and Syncing changes]({{< ref "/dev-reference/metadata-management/pushing-and-syncing.md" >}}) for more details.

---

## **Delete App**

If you no longer need an app, you can delete it. This will remove all instances as well as the database, which means all data will be lost.

![Delete App](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/delete_app.png)

{{< notes type="warning" >}}
This operation cannot be undone, so please be careful.
{{< /notes >}}

{{< notes type="note" >}}
Only the app owner can perform this action.
{{< /notes >}}

---

## **App Templates**

![Make App a Template](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/app_make_a_template.png)

If you want to turn an app into a template, you can do so by enabling the `Make this app a template` flag. Once this option is enabled, your app will appear in the list of templates when creating new apps (inside your account only).

---

## **Cloning Apps**

![Clone App](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/clone_app.png)

You can create a clone of your app by clicking the `Clone App` button. This will create a new app using the same plan as the current app with the selected environment. Please note that data will also be copied (up to 1,000 records per entity).

{{< notes type="tip" >}}
Cloning your apps is useful when you want to test some changes in your app without affecting the original version.
{{< /notes >}}

---

## **Upgrade Strategy**

![Upgrade Strategy](/images/vendor/platform-ref/managing-apps/upgrade_strategy.png)

You can change the upgrade strategy of your app by selecting `Stable` or `Latest`. By default every app will be created with a `Stable` upgrade strategy. This means that your app will be running the stable version of the platform.
If you want the latest features available you can change by selecting the `Latest` upgrade strategy. Note that this change will be applied instantly and can take a few moments for your environments to redeploy with the new version.
If you are downgrading from a `Latest` to a `Stable` version, the setting will be saved but not applied until a new release of the platform.

{{< notes type="note" >}}
Only the app owner can perform this action.
{{< /notes >}}

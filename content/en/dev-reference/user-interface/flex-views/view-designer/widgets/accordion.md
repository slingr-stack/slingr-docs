The available settings are described as below:

### Label

This represents the human-readable widget label. It's what appears in the heading section of the accordion when it is displayed.

### Name

The name must not contain special characters or spaces; only letters and numbers are allowed.

### Visible

Indicates the visibility of the widget, which can be configured with the following options:

- **`Always`**: The widget is perpetually accessible.

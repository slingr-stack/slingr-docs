Shortcuts available in the flow designer:

- `ctrl`+`alt`+`f` : to toggle the fullscreen mode.
- `shift`+ `click, hold & drag`: to draw a multi-selection area. 
- `Escape`: to remove any active multi-selection. Also removes the selection of the selected step and collapses the properties panel.


### Steps multi-selection:

It is possible to select several steps or a full flow at once by pressing the above shortcut. This is a useful to relocate fast the flow or a portion of it as you can see in the below image:

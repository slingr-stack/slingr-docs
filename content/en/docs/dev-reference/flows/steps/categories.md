### Definition

The steps are predefined components that fulfill specific functionalities. They are used in a flow to create code in a more graphic way, so you don't have to learn to code in any specific language. Instead, you just need to drag and drop the steps from the steps palette and into the canvas area, and then connect them by dragging a connector from a source step and dropping it into a target step. Steps are divided into categories where each category contains multiple steps. You can find the documentation for each step in the following pages.

### Categories

#### System

The first category in which you can find steps is called "System". Here you will find the steps that will help you with the construction of your flow. For example, here you can find the logger step that logs something on the monitor of your application or the set var step that creates a new variable in the context. All the steps that you will find in this category are: start, end, logger, script, and set var. You can find the documentation for each of these steps in the following pages.

In this section, we will learn how to use the actions we implemented in the previous section. We added a new column called Actions to the grid view, which allows us to execute the actions from there or from other places in the app.

To test the actions, make sure to check that the preconditions are working as expected. Also, verify that the status cannot be changed in the edit view.

If you encounter any issues, review the previous section to see if you missed anything.

In the next section, we will create a new type of view that will work perfectly with the actions we implemented. If you want to learn more, let's proceed to the next section.

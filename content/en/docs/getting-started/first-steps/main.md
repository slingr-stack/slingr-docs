The best way to learn how to use Slingr is to build something. Luckily for you, we have made some tutorials to help you get started. In these tutorials, we won’t go through all the features of the platform. The goal is that you get a general idea of how it works and then you can start building something great by yourself.

In these tutorials, we are going to assume you already have a developer account. If not, go ahead and <a href="">create one here</a>

### Available tutorials
- ```Working with Event Planner:``` In this tutorial we are going to make some improvements to the Event Planner App. The estimated time of completion is 15 minutes. Go to the tutorial.
- ```Task Manager App:``` In this app, users will be able to create tasks, assign them to other users, move them through different columns and send notifications to Slack channels. The estimated time of completion is 40 minutes. Go to the [tutorial]()

If you just want to see the resulting apps, we have made them available as templates. So you only need to create an app [here]() and select the app that you want as a template. Keep in mind, that if you start the Task Manager App from a template, you will need to configure the Slack integration as explained in the section [Integration with Slack]() of the Task Manager tutorial.
